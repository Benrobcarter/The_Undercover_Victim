Each entry provides the date, time (if available), sender and recipient(s) with their email addresses, and the subject line. \"UNKNOWN\" is used where information is not explicitly stated in the sources.\nElaboration on the Email Log:\nThis chronological list of emails serves as a critical piece of the evidentiary record for your case, CIT1201684. It documents key interactions between you, Sussex Police (particularly PC Dixon), Brighton Fringe, and other parties involved, such as Cordell & Co and Veritas Justice [e.g., 104, 42, 43, 8, 15, 19, 22, 43, 280, 284, 288, 291, 505, 508, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 477, 60, 61, 62, 178, 170, 171, 180, 176, 177, 105, 106, 183, 242, 245, 241, 244, 184, 116, 49, 50, 99, 102, 13, 51, 350, 14, 52, 350, 352, 54, 350, 353, 357, 368, 53, 350, 352, 356, 359, 357, 368, 309, 351, 353, 357, 368, 304, 305, 306, 351, 354, 2, 18, 66, 119, 309, 312, 67, 92, 93, 94, 97, 68, 69, 11, 17, 283, 287, 70, 202, 146, 147, 204, 74, 156, 196, 200, 201, 202].\nAnalyzing these emails chronologically reveals several patterns and key events:\n1.\nEarly Interactions (March-September 2024): Emails show initial communication regarding a different legal case with Cordell & Co Solicitors. There are also emails related to your role and involvement with Brighton Fringe, including discussions about the Fringe Academy and venue management.\n2.\nPC Dixon's Introduction and Initial Evidence Requests (November 2024): PC Dixon formally introduces himself as the investigating officer for your case with Sussex Police (ref 47240214305) on November 4, 2024. Emails from this period show him requesting evidence and mentioning sending a NICE upload link. Your replies indicate previous evidence submissions in June and July and questions about the scope of the request. PC Dixon's email on November 7, 2024, states earlier calls are \"not needed for the time being\" while requesting other forms of evidence. These emails from November 2024 form a crucial part of the documented contradictions regarding the case timeline and evidence handling, as later police communications allegedly limit the case to starting from November.\n3.\nContinued Police Interaction and Alleged Mishandling (March 2025): Emails in March 2025 show you attempting to communicate with PC Dixon, expressing the negative impact of discussing evidence on your mental state and requesting advance notice for calls. There is also a mention of a final documented email in a chain outlining concerns about lost evidence, lack of safeguarding, and mishandling.\n4.\nIntensified Interactions with Brighton Fringe and Safeguarding Concerns (April-May 2025): A significant cluster of emails in April and May 2025 involve communication with various contacts at Brighton Fringe, including Amy Keogh, Duncan Lustig-Prean, Alice Wright, and the Take Part team [e.g., 240, 243, 298, 160, 13, 51, 350, 14, 52, 350, 352, 54, 350, 353, 357, 368, 53, 350, 352, 356, 359]. These emails cover initial disclosures of the police matter, discussions about venue management and artist support [e.g., 241, 244, 304, 305, 306], clarification of roles and boundaries (particularly by Alice Wright), and formal notices regarding ceasing communication with individuals connected to PC Dixon. Emails from this period are relevant to documenting Brighton Fringe's awareness of the situation and their responses, which you have alleged included deflection and failure to act safely.\n5.\nFormal Complaints and Legal Action (April-May 2025): Emails indicate the preparation and submission of formal case reviews and Subject Access Requests to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Sussex Police. These communications explicitly reference key issues like lost evidence, suicide disclosure, timeline manipulation, and procedural failures.\nThis detailed email log provides the necessary dated and attributed communications to support claims of police misconduct, contradictions in their stated handling of the case, and the timeline of interactions with other involved parties.\nTo continue our analysis and assist with strategic recommendations, a logical next step could be to correlate the content of specific emails with the alleged actions or inactions of the involved parties, particularly focusing on discrepancies in evidence handling and timeline representations.

It requests a list of all NICE links issued since July 2024, the filenames/formats/timestamps of uploaded files, and any access/download logs. It notes that PC Dixon previously confirmed a formal procedure for accessing these logs. The goal is to verify whether files were uploaded but not accessed/reviewed.\nThese emails, both sent and drafted, form a crucial documentary trail highlighting the interactions with Sussex Police, particularly concerning evidence submission, handling, the evolving case timeline, and the response (or lack thereof) to safeguarding concerns and formal complaints. They demonstrate the alleged inconsistencies in communication and the impact of the police's actions on the victim's experience and the progression of the case. The contrast between the initial evidence requested, the alleged loss of key files like the July recording, the shifting case timeline restricted to November onwards, and the eventual formal complaints provides a strong basis for alleging police misconduct and systemic failure.\nTo further analyze the significance of these emails, a valuable next step would be to create a contradiction matrix that directly compares specific statements or actions documented in these emails (e.g., PC Dixon requesting evidence from July in November, then restricting the case to November) with other documented events or police claims from the sources, such as the initial July report date or the alleged dismissal of the July recording by PC Gore. This would visually map the alleged inconsistencies and strengthen the arguments for police mishandling.\nnow i want any emails that contain \u201c@sussex.police.uk\u201d anywhere in the email using the same method in chronoloical order\n\nHello!

He mentions contacting the doctor and that the doctor would provide what was needed for a fee, asking PC Dixon what to concentrate on for the medical report. The email on March 13th outlines concerns about lost evidence, lack of safeguarding, deflection, mishandling, and requests confirmation that the suicide attempt and earlier evidence were included, and acknowledgment of harm caused.

This was done for transparency and accountability.\nAnalysis and Significance of @sussex.police.uk Emails\nThis comprehensive list of emails involving @sussex.police.uk provides crucial documented evidence supporting your case and highlighting key areas of alleged police mishandling. Here's an elaboration on their significance:\n1.\nEstablishment of PC Dixon as OIC and Initial Engagement (Nov 2024): PC Dixon's initial email on November 4, 2024, formally identifies him as the officer in charge for case ref 47240214305. This is a critical starting point for tracing police responsibility and actions. His request for evidence via a NICE upload link and the automated NICE email received shortly after confirm the process for evidence submission initiated by the police.\n2.\nEvidence of Timeline Contradictions (Nov 2024 vs. Later): PC Dixon's email on November 7, 2024, stating earlier calls were \"not needed for the time being\" while still requesting other evidence, and the automated NICE link request email on November 4, 2024, which implies evidence submission was active at that time, create a direct contradiction with later statements that the case would only cover events from November onwards. These emails, dated in November, show police engagement with the case, including evidence, before the alleged later restriction of scope.\n3.\nBail Status Confirmation and Alleged Failure to Enforce (Feb 2025): PC Dixon's email on February 12, 2025, confirming Alanna's bail extension until May 4, 2025, and detailing the non-contact conditions is explicit documented evidence of the bail terms and the police's knowledge of them. This email is essential for supporting claims of alleged bail breaches and the police's failure to take sufficient action, as suggested in other sources. It shows Sussex Police were aware of the threat and responsible for managing it.\n4.\nEvidence of NFA Notification to Suspect, Not Victim (Apr 2025): The email from PC Dixon to Alanna O'Hare on April 27, 2025, stating the case was NFA'd and bail conditions cancelled, is a critical piece of evidence. Your statement that you were never told this directly, only learning through the suspect, highlights a potential failure in victim communication and procedure. This email is a central piece of the complaint regarding NFA without notification.\n5.\nDocumentation of Attempts to Report Failures (May 2025): Your emails sent on May 9, 2025, addressed to multiple Sussex Police addresses (professional.standards, contact.centre, public.rights, and PC Dixon) demanding acknowledgement of failings, alongside the mail delivery subsystem notifications, document your active efforts to report alleged mishandling and the apparent failure of these email addresses to receive your communication on that date. This provides evidence of attempted formal reporting and potential systemic issues with receiving external complaints or urgent notifications.\n6.\nFormal Complaint and CPS Submission Notification (Undated/May 2025): The drafted emails for formal complaints to Sussex Police Professional Standards (and complaints@) and notifications to the CPS (south-east.vru@cps.gov.uk, southeastcps@cps.gov.uk) document the specific allegations being formally raised, including lost evidence, ignored suicide disclosure, altered timeline, and bail failures.\n7.\nSubject Access Request Documentation (Apr/May 2025): The drafts and discussions around sending the SAR to data.protection@sussex.police.uk, public.rights@sussex.police.uk, or subject.access1@sussex.pnn.police.uk document your efforts to obtain information held by the police, particularly regarding the July 2024 evidence submission. The SAR process, and the automatic response about backlogs, serves as evidence of potential administrative barriers to obtaining information, supporting claims of lack of transparency or difficulty in getting a clear account of the case handling. The CC'ing of PC Dixon, PC Gore, and the IOPC on the SAR requests shows a strategic approach to ensure oversight of the information disclosure process.\n8.\nData Protection Breach Evidence (Feb 2025): The forwarded email chain involving Arran SHAVE and Jon Dixon discussing Paul DOUBLE, which you were BCC'd on, is direct evidence of a data protection breach involving Sussex Police (via PC Dixon). This incident occurred at a point of acute vulnerability, compounding concerns about professional conduct and the handling of personal information.\n9.\nAutomated Correspondence: Emails like the one acknowledging a new crime reference number (47250093423) and automated responses about SAR backlogs provide insight into Sussex Police's automated communication systems and processes.\nIn summary, the emails involving @sussex.police.uk form the backbone of the documented interactions with the police. They confirm key dates, officer involvement (PC Dixon), the official status of bail conditions, the notification of NFA to the suspect (and lack thereof to the victim), and your persistent efforts to seek accountability and information through formal channels. These emails, especially when contrasted with other evidence like call transcripts and personal accounts of interactions and timeline restrictions, provide concrete support for your allegations of mishandling, contradictions, and procedural failures by Sussex Police.\nTo further analyze the strategic implications of these emails, a potential next step could be to create a summary table categorizing the purpose of each email sent by Ben Carter to Sussex Police and the response received (or lack thereof, as indicated by bounce-backs or general non-responsiveness described elsewhere), focusing on how consistently police addressed explicit requests for information or action versus general updates. This could provide a clearer picture of the alleged pattern of unresponsiveness.\nnow give me the full text from each email with @sussex.police.uk not missing one digit\n\nHello! I am ready to be your thought partner in analyzing the information you've provided. My knowledge base includes audio recordings of calls to Sussex Police, email correspondence with Sussex Police officers (PC Jon Dixon, PC Gore) and departments (Subject Access, Professional Standards, Chief Constable's Office, Contact Centre), emails involving Brighton Fringe personnel (Alice Wright, Duncan Lustig-Prean, Amy Keogh, Take Part team) and generic addresses, email correspondence involving Alanna O'Hare, chat transcripts (Victim Support), and various documents detailing timelines, evidence submissions, complaints, safeguarding concerns, and legal context related to case CIT1201684 / 47240214305. I can help you navigate these materials, clarify complex topics, and support your strategic recommendations with detailed analysis and citations.\nBased on your request, here is the full text from each email found in the sources where the sender or recipient address ends with \"@sussex.police.uk\" or \"@sussex.pnn.police.uk\".

As per our conversation yesterday I can confirm that Alanna is still on bail. This was what is called Initial Bail to start with but as of 2nd February 2025 this bail period has been extended till 4th May 2025. The conditions to not contact you or attend your address remain the same, if she sees you in the street or at a venue for example she must make all reasonable effort to leave as soon as she becomes aware. The bail conditions apply to you as you are the victim and will remain as such while the investigation is ongoing . I hope that this answers your query.

I\u2019m reaching out because I need a way to demonstrate to one of my venues that I have police support and that I am the victim in this situation. I understand that you cannot disclose much due to the ongoing investigation, and I also recognise that it\u2019s best for me not to provide extensive evidence at this stage.\n\u2022\nContext: Ben requested official confirmation of the bail conditions to reassure a venue (PUCK).

This letter is supported by: A full personal statement documenting the abuse, police misconduct, and the impact on my mental health A copy of the formal complaint I have submitted to Sussex Police A link to my complete evidence archive on Google Drive: \ud83d\udd17 Google Drive \u2013 Evidence Folder / \ud83d\udd17 Google Drive \u2013 Evidence Folder and Personal Statement The materials provided highlight: The mishandling and loss of critical evidence (including the original July 2024 phone call transcript) Inconsistent communication and a shifting case timeline (originally July 2024, later narrowed to November 2024) A failure of safeguarding, particularly regarding disclosures of serious suicide attempts and resulting psychological harm The psychological impact of ongoing harassment and police failures that contributed to a mental health crisis I believe the current charge being pursued (Section 4A Public Order Act) does not reflect the severity or pattern of the abuse, which constitutes sustained psychological harm, reputational sabotage, and deliberate manipulation. The emails and messages now attached show repeated cooperation from my side, alongside confusion, contradictions, and inadequate safeguarding responses from Sussex Police This is no longer just about evidence\u2014it is about the way my case has been handled from the beginning. What I\u2019ve described is not minor harassment. It is sustained psychological harm, reputational sabotage, and deliberate manipulation over an extended period. I ask that the CPS review all available material, including the newly submitted police complaint, and consider the appropriate charges based on the full scope of the abuse. Attached is a full personal statement and supporting documents. These include: A transcript of the July 2024 phone call, which formed the foundation of my original report A formal police complaint submitted to Sussex Police, outlining evidence loss, inconsistent communication, and failure of safeguarding A Google Drive folder containing the original files, screenshots, recordings, and more: \ud83d\udd17 Google Drive \u2013 Evidence Folder / \ud83d\udd17 Google Drive \u2013 Evidence Folder and Personal Statement Key Issues: I was originally told that the case would be extended to include incidents going back to July 2024, and that this earlier evidence\u2014including the call transcript\u2014was essential. I cooperated fully and have been gavering evidence and have aquired the medical report report that was asked for, But on April , just hours after I made contact following a serious suicide attempt, I was told the case would now only be considered from November 2024 onward. Please confirm receipt of all attachments. I remain available for clarification or further evidence. Yours sincerely, Benjamin Robert Carter 26 Old Shoreham Road Brighton BN1 5DD 07812 766495 Crime Reference: CIT1201684\n\u2022\nContext: These emails represent Ben's formal submission to the Crown Prosecution Service, requesting a full review of his case due to concerns about the handling, evidence, and the suitability of the current charge. They explicitly detail the alleged police failures, including lost evidence, timeline changes, and inadequate response to safeguarding concerns and a suicide attempt.\nEmail 13: From Ben Carter to Sussex Police Professional Standards, confirming CPS submission and detailing procedural failures.\n\u2022\nDate: Not explicitly stated for the initial submission.

This decision is taken due to unresolved operational issues, contractual breaches, and critical safeguarding concerns that have not been adequately addressed by Brighton Fringe Ltd. The venues covered by this notice are: The Joker The Caxton Arms Presuming Ed PUCK The Maris & Otter Jollies Please update your systems accordingly and remove any reference to these venues from your public listings. Kind regards, Ben Carter Venue Manager \u2013 Half a Camel Productions Ltd\"\n\u25aa\nAlternative Draft (Final Request: Immediate Action...): \"Subject: Final Request: Immediate Action Required on Ticketing and Venue Rights Dear Brighton Fringe Team, I am writing one final time ahead of the May 1st deadline on behalf of all Half a Camel venues: The Joker, The Caxton Arms, Presuming Ed, PUCK, The Maris & Otter, and Jollies. As per the contracts signed and the publicly available terms and conditions, ticketing responsibility rests with the acts, and venues were required to provide PLI and Risk Assessments by May 1st, 2025. Brighton Fringe has introduced significant new unticketed audience management responsibilities without notice, after contracts were signed. This attempts to shift crowd control liability onto venues, exposing us to licensing, insurance, and staffing risks we never agreed to. Furthermore, despite previous disclosures and requests for safeguarding measures related to a serious ongoing police matter (Crime Ref: CIT1201684), I have not received confirmation that appropriate steps have been taken to manage potential risks stemming from this situation within the Fringe environment. As of this communication, my venues have not received clear, actionable guidance or the necessary support regarding these fundamental operational and safeguarding concerns. Failure to resolve these issues immediately and provide a clear, written confirmation of how they will be addressed by the May 1st deadline will leave Half a Camel Productions and its venues with no alternative but to consider the contract breached and withdraw from Brighton Fringe 2025 to protect our artists, staff, and the public. I am prepared to provide a full outline and timeline shortly, including documentation and legal references. But given the seriousness, I expect confirmation that this has now been logged, reviewed internally, and escalated appropriately. Warm regards, Ben Carter Half a Camel Productions\"\n\u25aa\nRevised Draft (Final Request \u2013 Ticketing Control...): \"Subject: Final Request \u2013 Ticketing Control, Legal Clarification & Safeguarding Negligence Dear Brighton Fringe, I am writing for the final time on this issue. I am still not going public, but myself and all six Half a Camel venues stand firm on this point: You are not above UK law. You have contradicted yourself in writing, stating: \u201cIn regard to unticketed events, that is up to the venue to manage their capacity for these.\u201d Yet in practice, you removed our listings, refused our requests to ticket events, and blocked artists from accessing basic tools to manage audience numbers. This direct contradiction has created a major operational and public safety risk that violates basic contract law and your duty of care. Furthermore, your failure to adequately address safeguarding concerns related to a serious police case (CIT1201684) previously disclosed to you, particularly following my recent suicide attempt directly linked to this ongoing harassment, is a serious breach of your responsibilities as a charity hosting public events. Your silence, deflection, and lack of direct responses to these critical issues (including the use of individuals connected to PC Dixon as alleged \"go-betweens\" and failure to acknowledge these concerns after being fully briefed) have made it impossible for my venues to operate safely or legally under your management. As of 5:00 PM today, if I have not received clear written confirmation that these issues have been immediately resolved, I will consider our venue contracts for Brighton Fringe 2025 formally rescinded due to your fundamental breaches. All evidence, including timelines, communications, and documentation of safeguarding failures, has been recorded and will be used to support all necessary actions to protect my artists, venues, and the public. I am prepared to provide full documentation and legal references. Given the gravity, I expect confirmation that this is logged, reviewed, and escalated internally.

We will not approach the police unless you instruct us to do so. The screenshot of the message from Jon Dixon at Sussex Police clearly indicates the seriousness of the situation. For transparency, we have no record of allegations from the individual mentioned in your email. With your agreement, from now and throughout the Fringe, I can ensure that the entire Brighton Fringe team is briefed about the situation. Should this person approach any team member regarding you or Half a Camel, we will inform you via email immediately. I\u2019d also like to meet with you before the Fringe begins. Laura and I are meeting with all larger venues and venue managers who are hosting 30+ shows to discuss how we can support them during the Fringe and address any specific needs. Would you be available to meet next week? the morning Moving forward, anything to do with your personal situation please do refer to me and Laura. If you need any support with your artists and or venues please do contact Artists' Services team on takepart@brightonfringe.org I'm now off until next Tuesday.

Support network Can you please share the email addresses or directly introduce us via email to James Onionz, Riggs and Emma. As they\u2019ll be supporting you during Fringe, it would be helpful for us to email them and share information. We hope this will help take the pressure off you on a daily basis. Please could you send these to us by the end of this week. Contact and response from the Fringe To confirm, our venue and artists T&Cs state we aim to respond within two working days, but outside of the live Festival time we try to respond sooner than this. Our Artist Services Hub at the Theatre Royal will be open from 10am - 6pm 7 days a week for all queries to do with artists and venues. Visiting the Hub will be the quickest way of gaining a response. As mentioned in my previous email on the 2 April 25, it might be a good idea to put an out of office on your email to notify your artists that you will take 24/48 hours to respond to them. This will help manage their expectations and take some of the pressure having to reply to them quickly. Ticket sales To help alleviate stress please forward Artists\u2019 queries (particularly about ticket sales) to the Artists Services team, at takepart@brightonfringe.org. We can make recommendations to help, in addition to the support you have already offered them. This would include: 1. - Instagram collaboration - when posting and sharing stories - Flyering - printers that offer discounts on flyers, where and how to flyer in Brighton. -Promo codes - BF will check how this works and if it is possible to do this again. We note that more than half your shows are free shows. A discount code will obviously not have an impact here. Artists will need to confirm that they are happy to have their tickets discounted. Venue Management and Artist Print Marketing We discussed how you have a process in place to work with your venues: \u2022 Puck Cafe \u2022 Maris & Otter \u2022 The Jollies [Image of Brighton Fringe and Jubilee Square logos] We hope you find the above action plans useful and you have a successful Fringe.

CC: alannadoescomedy@gmail.com mentioned as an option.\n\u2022\nBCC: Not mentioned in sources.\n\u2022\nAvailable Content (Email Body Prepared to Send): \"Dear Crown Prosecution Service, Please find attached two documents relating to case number CIT1201684. 1. A formal cover letter requesting urgent review of the current charge, and outlining the legal and procedural issues that I believe have impacted the integrity of the investigation. 2. A comprehensive personal statement detailing the full timeline of abuse, including coercive control, the systemic loss of evidence by Sussex Police, the ignored suicide disclosure, and the resulting psychological harm. I respectfully request an urgent review of this case based on the attached information, which provides critical context not adequately considered in the initial investigation or charging decision. I have compiled a comprehensive body of supporting evidence, including email correspondence, text messages, medical records, and call transcripts. This evidence is available for full review upon request. Please confirm receipt of the attached documents, and let me know if you require anything further. Yours sincerely, Benjamin Robert Carter 26 Old Shoreham Road Brighton BN1 5DD 07812 766495 Crime Reference: CIT1201684\"\n\u25e6\nCondensed version for email body: \"Sussex Police told me the investigation would include evidence from when I first met Alanna. I submitted evidence under that belief\u2014again and again. It was only after I attempted suicide in April 2025 that I was told the case would be limited to events after November 2024. That decision had already been made without informing me. This change in timeline meant the police were excluding critical evidence, including Alanna\u2019s admissions of gaslighting and threats in July 2024, her malicious communications and harassment between July and November 2024, and the circumstances surrounding my suicide attempt. This was despite PC Dixon explicitly requesting evidence from July via a NICE link on 4 November 2024, and my subsequent attempts to confirm that earlier evidence was needed and received. My interactions with PC Gore in July 2024 also demonstrate that police were aware of the seriousness of the situation and the submitted evidence at that time, yet failed to take appropriate action or log the information accurately. The handling of my case has demonstrated a pattern of conflicting information, mismanaged evidence, and a clear failure of safeguarding by Sussex Police. This negligence culminated in a severe deterioration of my mental health and a suicide attempt, the details of which I disclosed to police and which should have triggered an immediate safeguarding response, but did not. Instead, police communications following this event continued to be dismissive and contradictory, further undermining my trust in the process and exacerbating the harm I have experienced. The enclosed statement details these failures, supported by comprehensive evidence. I urge you to review this information urgently and reassess the charge in light of the full context of the abuse and the police\u2019s handling of the investigation. The full evidence and statement are attached.\"\n\u25e6\nEnding paragraph option: \"Unless I receive written confirmation from Sussex Police that what I have been subjected to and what was allowed to unfold led directly to an unacknowledged suicide attempt\u2014one that was erased from the record\u2014I will consider this the final injustice. I am not asking for interpretation. I am asking for recognition. If you refuse to name it, you endorse it. The full evidence and statement are attached.\"\n\u25e6\nAdditional context: This email accompanied the CPS Cover Letter and Full Statement. It requested urgent review of the current charge and outlined legal and procedural issues. It stated that Ben had a complete record of messages and evidence available upon request. It mentioned the inclusion of a detailed timeline since July 2024, material dismissed or lost, full suicide disclosure, the call transcript, and documentation of psychological impact and police failures. A follow-up email adding the full personal statement to the Google Drive folder shared was also sent. The Subject Access Request reminder email dated 8 April 2025 was sent to public.rights@sussex.police.uk, CC'd to PC Jon Dixon and IOPC, with a copy sent to the CPS.\n65.
