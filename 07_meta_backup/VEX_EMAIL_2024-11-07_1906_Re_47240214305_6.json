Please upload any videos, there’s mention of one video of\nAlanna banging on the door?\nEvidence of anything after the time you made it clear to Alanna that you didn’t want any further contact\nfrom her is what is most relevant, but anything else fairly recent involving her making any threats or\nanything you feel is particularly harassing or distressful to yourself."
