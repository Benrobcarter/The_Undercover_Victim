  "summary": "On 18 June 2025, a deliberately covert 101 call was made by the victim to expose the false narrative being constructed by Sussex Police via the creation of a decoy case assigned to \u2018PC Russell\u2019. The call, which explicitly probes two separate crime references, triggers a reversal of the deception four days later \u2014 with the Russell thread disappearing and Dixon reappearing. This event confirms systemic manipulation of records, a split narrative used to mislead the IOPC, and a failure to safeguard the victim.",
