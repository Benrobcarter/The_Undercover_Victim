He is told, yet again, that PC Dixon is his assigned officer\u2014despite Dixon having blocked him on WhatsApp, failed to log a suicide disclosure, and being the subject of an IOPC investigation. Ben pleads for help, but is repeatedly told his case is closed, that there are no updates, and that reporting anything further would be futile. The call handler\u2019s dismissiveness escalates Ben\u2019s emotional distress and solidifies the contradiction that Sussex Police has no working safeguarding mechanism.",
