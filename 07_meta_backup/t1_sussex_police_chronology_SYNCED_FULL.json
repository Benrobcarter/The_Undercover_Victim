    "public_summary": "A covert 101 call used to probe the fabricated case split between PC Russell and PC Dixon. The resulting reversal four days later confirmed that Sussex Police had engineered a decoy narrative to deflect oversight. The call exposes systemic record manipulation and a deliberate attempt to mislead the IOPC."
