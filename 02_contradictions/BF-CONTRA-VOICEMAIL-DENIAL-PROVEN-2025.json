A voicemail left on 21 March 2025 by Ben Carter directly references the IOPC, a safeguarding concern involving Alexander Voodoo, and suicide escalation. This folder contains both the voicemail audio and full transcript, proving Duncan's denial to be a deliberate obstruction of safeguarding accountability."
