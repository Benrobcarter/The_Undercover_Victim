      "summary": "On 7 May 2025, Brighton Fringe Managing Director Amy Keogh admitted in writing that Alice Wright was acting as an intermediary, stating: 'We're sorry we've not been able to fully understand what you've been asking for from us -- until Alice explained it to us.' This confirms Fringe was not engaging directly with Ben Carter but was using Alice as a proxy to interpret, filter, and relay information. It destroys the claim that Alice was neutral and shows she was embedded in a coordinated strategy to control communication and mitigate liability. Amy’s use of the phrase 'we're so relieved to know that you don't hate us,' which Alice had already seeded in advance, proves that Alice was involved in crafting both internal and external messaging about Ben's state of mind."
