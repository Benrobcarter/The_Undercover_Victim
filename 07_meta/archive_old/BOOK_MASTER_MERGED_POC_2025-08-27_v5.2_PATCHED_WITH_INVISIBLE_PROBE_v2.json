The call serves as a recorded, real-time intelligence-gathering operation to confirm my suspicion that Sussex Police had created a false paper trail to mislead the IOPC.\nThe Strategy: A Covert Probe\nKnowing that a full call would trigger identity verification and log my inquiry in high-level systems, I deliberately remained at the triage level. My objective was to confirm the existence of the \"PC Russell\" decoy (Crime Ref: 47250093423) and its separation from my original case (Crime Ref: 47240214305) without alerting the system to my awareness. I feigned simple confusion to elicit information.\nWhat the Call Proves:\n1. Confirmation of the Decoy: The triage handler immediately confirmed that Crime Ref ...93423 was assigned to \"PC Russell,\" who had conveniently \"just missed him\" and \"finished about half an hour ago.\" This confirmed the name on the letter I received was active in the call handling system.\n2. Confirmation of the Fractured Timeline: When I casually introduced my original crime reference (...305) and suggested \"they're kind of like the same one,\" the handler confirmed they were being handled by a \"separate officer\" who was on \"rest days.\" This proves the deliberate administrative separation of the cases.\n3. Proof of a Pre-Prepared Narrative: The existence of this parallel structure—two crime numbers for the same ongoing issue, assigned to two different officers, one of whom was a phantom—is not an accident. It is evidence of a pre-planned deception strategy, likely designed to show the IOPC that my complaints about PC Dixon had been addressed by reassigning the case, while in reality, he retained control of the core file.\nThe Reversal: Proof of Impact\nThe success of this covert probe is confirmed by what happened next. Just four days after this call, on May 22, 2025, the narrative was reversed. Further inquiries revealed that the \"PC Russell\" case had vanished, and all matters were suddenly consolidated back under PC Dixon. This sudden realignment proves that my \"invisible\" probe had likely triggered an internal panic, forcing them to dismantle the very deception I had just confirmed was in place.\nConclusion:\nThis call is not a record of me being a victim of confusion; it is a record of me exposing it. It demonstrates a calculated test of the system's integrity, which it failed spectacularly. By staying in triage, I was able to get a snapshot of their cover-up without appearing on their radar. This is irrefutable evidence of a coordinated attempt to manipulate the official record to mislead an independent investigation.",
