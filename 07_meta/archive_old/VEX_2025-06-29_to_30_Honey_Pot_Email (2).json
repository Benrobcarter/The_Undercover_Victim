  "claim_summary": "A deliberately crafted ‘honey pot’ email was sent around 29–30 June 2025 to test Sussex Police’s record integrity after a SAR refusal. The email intentionally mixed a false timeline statement with attachments (including an audio file and the ‘PC Russell’ letter as ‘proof of address’) to observe whether the system would detect and correct inconsistencies or simply absorb them.",
  "key_points": [
    "Email body contained a deliberate falsehood about a prior NICE‑link submission (‘wrong file, sent in November for a different crime’).",
    "Attachment 1: audio — “Alanna Shows UP At My Door Latet Monzo £100 26-09-24.mp3.”",
    "Attachment 2: image — letter assigning ‘PC Russell’ (used sarcastically as ‘proof of address’).",
    "Objective: probe whether Sussex Police systems could reconcile contradictory inputs and flag the inconsistency."
