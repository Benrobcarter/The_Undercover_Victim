  "title": "The Retaliatory Hang-Up: Refusal of Service Upon Recognition",
  "date": "2025-06-22",
  "summary": "This section analyses two back-to-back 101 calls (04:56 and 05:00) that were terminated by Sussex Police the moment the victim began to speak. Occurring just minutes after the Humiliation Protocol call, these hang-ups represent a coordinated and retaliatory refusal of service against a whistleblower. These actions amount to a calculated breach of duty and obstruction of victim rights.",

      "title": "The Incidents",
      "text": "Both calls ended immediately upon connection with a live handler. The first ends with the victim saying, \u201cHung up just from seeing who was calling.\u201d The second is even more damning: the victim attempts to report the previous hang-up and is hung up on again. The sound of the call dropping and the final 'Fucking hell' confirm retaliation."
    },
    {
      "title": "The Context is Everything",
      "text": "These events occurred within minutes of the victim confronting Sussex Police over crime number manipulation and institutional cover-up. This timing strongly implies the calls were terminated deliberately as retaliation."
    },
    {
      "title": "Constructive Refusal of Service",
      "text": "Sussex Police denied the victim their legal right to report incidents or access safeguarding by cutting the call based on recognition alone. This constitutes a serious breach of the Victims\u2019 Code and fundamental duty of care."
    },
    {
      "title": "Retaliation Against a Whistleblower",
      "text": "Rather than respond to the allegations, the police silenced the victim. These hang-ups are not glitches \u2014 they are punishments. They reflect institutional recognition and retaliatory targeting of someone holding the system accountable."
    }
  ],
  "conclusion": "These recordings are brief but powerful. They expose Sussex Police's strategy of silencing through technical denial. This was not a mistake \u2014 it was a retaliation. These events must be treated as serious police misconduct and referred to the IOPC.",
