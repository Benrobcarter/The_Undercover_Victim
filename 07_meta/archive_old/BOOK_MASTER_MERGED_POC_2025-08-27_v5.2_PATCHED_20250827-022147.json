Four days later (22 June 2025) the decoy vanished and control returned to Dixon — indicating a pre-prepared narrative dismantled after detection.\n\n**Contradictions surfaced**\n- **Decoy Case Split** — parallel case under “PC Russell.”\n- **Fractured Timeline** — administrative split of a single course of conduct.\n- **Reversal After Probe** — decoy dismantled post-confirmation.\n- **Misleading IOPC Narrative** — appearance of corrective action while control retained.\n\n**Clusters:** DEATH_BY_SILENCE · CROWBARRING_MYSELF_JUSTICE · CRIME_REF_47240214305_THREAD\n\n_This stub auto-pulls highlights from `VEX_2025-06-18_101_Invisible_Probe.json` for Divi/Don blocks._"
