[A: 00:06.0]
Hi, could I give you, crime reference number, please?

[B: 00:10.0]
Oh, sorry, your phone broke up then. Say again?

[A: 00:12.9]
Could I give you crime, crime reference number, please?

[B: 00:15.7]
I'm really sorry, I can't hear you on this line.

[A: 00:18.4]
Sorry. Is that better?

[B: 00:20.5]
Yes, it is. Yes.

[A: 00:21.6]
Thank you. Could I give you a crime reference number, please?

[B: 00:24.6]
Yeah, of course you can go ahead.

[A: 00:26.1]
Yeah. 4, 7. 2 4.

[B: 00:29.8]
Yep.

[A: 00:30.4]
014.

[B: 00:32.2]
Yep.

[A: 00:32.7]
1246.

[B: 00:39.9]
Bring that up.

[B: 00:44.3]
Confirm your name, please.

[A: 00:45.5]
My name is Ben Carter.

[B: 00:47.5]
Okay, how can I help?

[A: 00:49.7]
So I just called up 101 and they gave me a, a mobile number. But I'd just like to state that I'm not, I don't know who that mobile number was for. I don't know. Like, I wouldn't be, able to log things, properly through, like, cads and, you know, like the normal.

[A: 01:14.1]
I just found it very strange. I was given a mobile number.

[B: 01:19.1]
What for, sorry?

[A: 01:21.3]
To supply new evidence. No one gave me a cad. No one gave me anything like that. It was very strange. I was allowed a mobile number, but I wasn't allowed to know when he was on duty. And I am allowed to know when my OIC is on duty.

[A: 01:39.2]
And I've suddenly got a phone number which I've never had.

[B: 01:43.6]
Oh, so we are allowed to give out the officer in charge phone number.

[A: 01:52.0]
But not. Not tell me when he's working.

[B: 01:54.9]
I thought I can tell you when he's on duty.

[A: 01:57.3]
I'm just. I'm just saying I found that very strange, that, I was just given a random mobile number and not. Not told, like, when he was on duty. And I, I. But basically I haven't had an officer since April 6, which was the day of my suicide.

[A: 02:18.3]
Like, I'm alive. But. And, yeah, it's all starting again and I just want to time stamp and have it on, like basically the 101 recordings that I'm not consenting to any more corruption.

[A: 02:37.0]
So, when you say sorry.

[B: 02:41.9]
I'm really confused about what. What you mean that. What. No one's calling who's who. What, you're calling us?

[A: 02:47.6]
I'm calling you now. Yes.

[B: 02:49.6]
Yeah.

[A: 02:50.2]
And I just. I just want to state because I. I know at the moment, Well, I. I know there's been a lot of timeline manipulation to, make sure that evidence, basically my crime doesn't have any evidence in it. Like, you can probably see there, there's a lot of notes to not tell me anything.

[A: 03:10.5]
Am I right?

[B: 03:13.5]
The Crime message somebody giving me is from 2024.

[A: 03:16.4]
2024. Okay, but what was the last thing logged?

[B: 03:21.3]
What's the last thing logged?

[A: 03:22.7]
Yeah.

[B: 03:25.6]
Bear with that. You're asking for a phone call from the officer in charge.

[A: 03:31.1]
When was that?

[B: 03:33.2]
That is from July.

[A: 03:36.1]
July? Yeah. I never received that.

[B: 03:39.8]
Well, you wouldn't receive it because it goes. That's because it goes to the officer. So. What do you mean you'd never received it? Well, you never received the call.

[A: 03:46.1]
I have never received a call from an office since April 6th. There is an active IOPC investigation into this. I know I sound sort of stern.

[B: 03:58.8]
I'm gonna stop you there, because what is it that you're calling to ask now? What is it you're calling to report now to me?

[A: 04:05.0]
I'm, calling to state that I have not been able to give any evidence since April 6th. My suicide. And I would like an actual police officer and to be able to have some nice links and officially log all the evidence since April 6th, please.

[B: 04:27.9]
So you're saying there's new evidence?

[A: 04:30.6]
There's. There's evidence that's been deleted as well. There's evidence that's been deleted. There's been timelines. Who deleted What evidence? PC Dixon. But PC Dixon isn't just like, I.

[A: 04:46.4]
I was told. So basically I've. I've. I've got recorded 45, 101 calls where everyone. Everyone states that I'll get my officer to give me a bell. And it's. It was always PC Dixon until July.

[B: 05:02.3]
That's been investigated by the rapc. Yeah. So that's. That's. That's that.

[A: 05:06.4]
Yeah.

[B: 05:07.7]
I. I don't want to know about everything that's happened in the past.

[A: 05:11.0]
Okay.

[B: 05:14.1]
Is what's happened today. What is the reason for the call today?

[A: 05:19.3]
The reason for the call today is she's, my abusers messaged me a couple of times, but I have not.

[B: 05:29.3]
On what date today? So she's messaged you today?

[A: 05:34.0]
Yeah. They're nice. Nice.

[B: 05:35.7]
Okay.

[A: 05:36.4]
Nice messages saying what? Just I'm here for you, all that sort of stuff. But the thing is.

[B: 05:42.4]
Okay, so is there any court orders in place to say she's not allowed to contact you?

[A: 05:46.5]
That's what I want to know. Can you tell me?

[B: 05:49.6]
No, because I'm not an officer in charge.

[A: 05:54.1]
So what. What the kind of loop is you'll tell me that an officer in charge will ring me and I assure you I have not had an officer, ring me since April 6th. I know there's an active IOPC investigation, but I don't have access to the police.

[B: 06:13.8]
But what I'm saying is the, the rest of something you give me initially it was from 2024.

[A: 06:18.6]
Would you like another one?

[B: 06:19.5]
Would have been, would have mean it happened in 2024. So I would have thought there would have been an outcome given to you already. Whether that investigation was still ongoing or whether it's.

[A: 06:29.1]
I, I've not been allowed my victim's right to review. I've got, I've got another one.

[B: 06:33.7]
You can't be refused it. If you go online, you can apply.

[A: 06:38.9]
Professional, professional standards have refused it. And my subject access request, that was sent on April 9th. I, I, I, I know the, I know the way the law should, but the fact that, the IOPC are investigating it.

[B: 06:53.4]
Yeah.

[A: 06:53.8]
Shows there has been sometimes, sometimes there's a couple of bad apples. Like, if I give you my other, crime reference number.

[B: 07:05.1]
Yeah.

[A: 07:05.8]
I shouldn't have to, but, 4 7.

[B: 07:09.0]
If you want me to help you.

[A: 07:10.6]
No, no, no, no, no. So, so I'm not, I'm just saying by law, like, there should just be one crime reference.

[B: 07:19.9]
It depends on what crime it is and whether they are linked, whether there's a time frame, whether it's a same victim. Suspect should just be one crime number for everything.

[A: 07:30.2]
Okay. So it's 4724.

[B: 07:35.9]
Yep.

[A: 07:36.6]
02.

[B: 07:38.4]
Yep.

[A: 07:39.2]
14305.

[B: 07:45.5]
Again, this is from 2024. So. What?

[A: 07:50.0]
So, so what was the last thing logged? What, what evidence have I given? I'm the data subject.

[B: 07:56.2]
Listen to me, I, what I want to know is what it is today that you're calling to log.

[A: 08:02.0]
I'm stating that I haven't been able to log anything since April. Could I log it all with you?

[B: 08:12.9]
So this is from 2024 again?

[A: 08:16.3]
Yeah. Is my suicide on April 6th, included?

[B: 08:22.9]
And there's a, there's a log that's gone on there from today where you've called about half an hour ago.

[A: 08:29.6]
Yeah, but on April 6th is my.

[B: 08:33.5]
I'm not going to discuss all of it.

[A: 08:35.2]
You're not doing everything that's on there. You're not gonna, you're not gonna let me know.

[B: 08:39.7]
I can't prove, I can't prove who you are over the phone.

[A: 08:42.7]
Yes, you can.

[B: 08:44.7]
No, I can't.

[A: 08:45.6]
You can't use gdpr. No, you can't use GDPR as an excuse.

[B: 08:50.8]
I'm not gonna discuss everything that's written on every single note. If you want.

[A: 08:54.4]
I'm just asking for one. Just one.

[B: 08:56.9]
And I'm just saying I'm not answering you by going through everything.

[A: 09:00.0]
This is 101. This is 101. It's non emergency.

[B: 09:03.2]
Yeah. Doesn't matter if it's 101 or 999. I'm not going to give you information over the phone. I can't prove who you are.

[A: 09:09.6]
So. So what? What is your job then? What? What's your job?

[B: 09:15.3]
So I'm gonna end the call because I forgot.

[A: 09:17.1]
No, no, no no, no. I'm just asking what can you give me? Like what are you able to give?

[B: 09:22.6]
Take reports of crime.

[A: 09:24.3]
