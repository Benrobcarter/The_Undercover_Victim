I just wanted to\ndouble check with you if this was the case and if you would like me to contact those customers directly to make sure their booking is\ntransferred, but if no bookings have been made that's all fine.\nMany thanks,\nElin Eaton (she/her)\nBox Office Manager\nA: Office 4 at The Old Court House, 118 Church Street, Brighton, BN1 1UD \nP: 01273 91 72 72 \nW: www.brightonfringe.org \n#BrightonFringe #BF20\n  \n \nStay Connected: Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Website | YouTube\nSupport Us: Donate | easyfundraising | Friends Scheme  \nRegistered Charity Number: 1116367 | VAT Number: 892 5694 68 | Brighton …"
