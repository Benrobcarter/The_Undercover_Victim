  "excerpt": "URGENT: Box Office Breakdown & Libel Concerns\nOn 8 May 2025, I wrote to Brighton Fringe regarding the unsafe shift to unticketed donations.\nThis change left venues without a way to track capacity, breaching the premises licence.\nFurther, Duncanâ€™s email referencing my failure to produce a brochure, despite internal\nacknowledgement of their system failure, amounts to reputational libel.\nTrustees were aware of these risks. I request a full Subject Access Review and minutes\nof the board discussion that led to this systemic governance breach.\nBen Carter\n"
