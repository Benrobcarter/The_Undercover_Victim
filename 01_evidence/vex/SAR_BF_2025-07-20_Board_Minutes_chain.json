      "body": "Dear Duncan,\nThank you for your response.\nYour confirmation that the board minutes regarding my removal have ‚Äúyet to be written‚Äù raises serious concerns about transparency, legality, and safeguarding compliance under charity law.\nI am now formally requesting the following:\n1. Recording or Transcript of the Board Meeting\nPlease confirm:\nWhether the meeting at which my removal was decided was audio or video recorded;\nIf so, I request an unedited copy of the full recording, or a verbatim transcript including all references to:\nMyself\nSafeguarding concerns\nReputational or risk justifications\nAny votes or motions made\nIf the meeting was not recorded, I request written confirmation that:\nThe decision was made without a contemporaneous record;\nThe minutes are being written retroactively, under your exclusive control.\nThis raises the appearance that the board‚Äôs actions are being shaped after the fact, rather than governed by policy or accountability standards.\n2. Conflict of Interest Disclosure\nAs the Chair involved in:\nMy original safeguarding concerns,\nDecisions that followed,\nAnd the current drafting of minutes,\n‚Ä¶it is not appropriate for you to act as the sole approver or editor of the record. Please confirm whether any conflict of interest was declared, and who authorised your continued role in finalising the record.\n3. Basis for Removal\nPlease confirm:\nThe date and time of the board meeting where the decision was made;\nThe names of those in attendance;\nThe legal basis and organisational policy used to justify my removal.\nLegal Reference\nAs you are aware, Brighton Fringe is a registered charity. Under the Charities Act 2011 and Charity Commission guidance CC3 and CC9, trustees are legally required to:\nKeep accurate records of decisions;\nHandle safeguarding disclosures transparently;\nAvoid conflicts of interest;\nProtect whistleblowers from retaliation or erasure.\nYour refusal to disclose the full minutes ‚Äî while admitting they are yet to be written ‚Äî may constitute a breach of trustee duty, reputational governance, and charity law.\nI am therefore putting you on notice that this correspondence and any response (or non-response) may be submitted to the Charity Commission as part of a formal safeguarding and governance complaint.\nSincerely,\nBen Carter\n1/2 a üê™",
