  "summary": "Zoe, venue partner from Puck, confirms in a phone call that Brighton Fringe leadership admitted they had been plotting the takeover in advance. She states they tried to get her to sign a new contract, which she declined, expressing ethical discomfort. She also reveals the Fringe told her Ben Carter had 'delusions' and was 'paranoid' and had written to his GP to that effect. This is third-party confirmation of a premeditated hostile takeover, attempted seizure of business relationships, defamation, and special category data misuse."
