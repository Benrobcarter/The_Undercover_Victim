    "summary": "This master contradiction logs Ben Carter’s suicide attempt, ignored safeguarding disclosures, stalking risk, and the institutional failure of Sussex Police and Brighton Fringe to respond. The statement was delivered on 12 May 2025 via a multi-recipient email with third-party support from Veritas Justice. The file outlines systemic obstruction, data rights denial, narrative erasure, and gaslighting that pushed the complainant to the edge while offering a detailed timeline of abuse, failure, and strategic silence."
