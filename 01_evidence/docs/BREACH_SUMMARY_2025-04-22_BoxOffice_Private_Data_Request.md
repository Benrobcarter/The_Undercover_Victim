## What happened:

On 22 April 2025, Elin Eaton (Box Office Manager at Brighton Fringe) contacted Half A Camel Productions requesting the direct contact details of audience members who had booked tickets for the show *Crazy Stupid Funny* via the Half A Camel venue system.

The stated reason for this request was to ensure that these customers could “re-book” their tickets through the Brighton Fringe system following a planned ticket type change. Elin indicated a willingness to contact these individuals directly and asked for their information.

This request:
- Bypassed the venue’s clearly established booking protocols  
- Sought access to personal customer data without lawful basis or customer consent  
- Represented an attempt to override venue control of the booking process  
- Introduced a risk of duplicate ticketing, customer confusion, and operational misalignment

## Confirmed Breaches:

1. **Data Protection Violation (UK GDPR)**  
   Brighton Fringe requested personal audience data without demonstrable legal basis or consent from the data controller (Half A Camel Productions). This raises concerns under GDPR Articles 5 and 6.

2. **Venue Box Office Control Breach**  
   The venue had clearly established its own booking and customer management system. Brighton Fringe’s request violated the principle of venue-led autonomy over registrations and customer access.

3. **Uncoordinated Ticketing System Interference**  
   The Fringe’s reference to changing the ticket type internally, without venue oversight, illustrates dual system interference and risks double-booking or invalidation of existing bookings.

4. **Attempted Customer Contact Without Authorisation**  
   Offering to contact customers directly — while bypassing the venue — demonstrates institutional overreach and a failure to respect agreed communication boundaries.

## Clauses and Agreements Breached:

- **Brighton Fringe Venue Manager Agreement (Ticketing & Registration Clause)**  
  “Brighton Fringe Ltd. will work in partnership with venue managers to manage registrations and ticketing allocations in accordance with venue-specific processes.”

- **UK GDPR Article 5(1)(a)** – Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency  
- **UK GDPR Article 6(1)** – Lawful basis for processing  
- **ICO Code of Practice** – Sharing personal data
