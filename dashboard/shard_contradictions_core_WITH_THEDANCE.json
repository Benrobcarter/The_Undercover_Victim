Case References: 47240141246, 47240214305, CIT1201684\nSection 1: Complainant\u2019s Foreword\nOn July 21st, 2024, after four years of being gaslit and seeing my life through someone else's eyes, I made my first call for help. I said, \"Police, please.\" I was met with a silence that would last for a year, a silence that would push me to the very brink of my life.\nThis complaint documents what happens when a victim of crime is not just ignored, but is actively and systematically erased by the very institutions that are supposed to protect them. The evidence within this bundle will prove, beyond any doubt, a coordinated institutional failure by Sussex Police and its partner agencies. It will detail evidence tampering, catastrophic safeguarding breaches, and a culture of complicity that chose to protect itself rather than protect a human life.\nBut this is not just a story of my own survival. It is a story about my friend, Kim Box.\nThe same pattern of institutional failure, the same confusion, the same dismissal that I experienced, is exactly how Kim died. She was failed by the same police force. When I found myself on the same path, feeling the same despair and the same hopelessness, I knew I had a choice. I could become another statistic, another victim whose family would be left with nothing but questions.\nOr I could fight.\nI would never have ended my life. Not because I wasn't pushed to that edge\u2014I was. But because of Amy, and because of my little Milena, whose own mother is now looking after Kim's 13-year-old daughter who found her mother dead. I could not let that happen again. I could not let that snowball of grief and unanswered questions crush another family.\nSo I made a decision. I would not just survive; I would document my survival. I would walk the path they laid for Kim, but I would record every step, every lie, every failure. I would become the witness she never had.\nWhat I have been through was harrowing. But this complaint is not just for me. It is for Kim. It is for every victim whose last words were \"police, please,\" and who was met with silence. It is for their families, who deserve the closure of knowing that someone, finally, is holding this broken system to account.\nFinally, I want to be clear about the nature of this submission. I am aware of the gravity of the claims I am making, and I would not take this opportunity to put forward any opinion-based or conspiracist claims that are not completely backed by evidence. These are not opinions; they are documented facts.\nI am aware that it is in the interest of Sussex Police to frame me as an annoyance who should not be taken seriously. But I have full respect for the law when it is enforced correctly, and I am proud to live in a country where the police can be policed. The reason I am escalating this to you is because I have been left with no other choice. I currently have no access to emergency services and cannot leave my house. Daily, Sussex Police are changing crime numbers and dates. The Crown Prosecution Service has never heard of me.\nI am alerting you now that I am making a rational decision, because that is what I am. I am living in a world that has been made unsustainable by what these institutions have subjected me to. They think I am the victim. I am not. I feel I have a duty to stop what I have already proved has been hidden from you.\nSection 2: The Core Complaint & Timeline of Failures\nThis is not a complaint of poor service \u2014 it is a report of coordinated institutional failure. I am lodging this formal complaint to detail a series of systemic safeguarding breaches by Sussex Police, and to formally trigger my Victim\u2019s Right to Review (VRR) of the No Further Action (NFA) decision communicated to the suspect in my stalking case\u2014without informing me.\nThis is not a standard complaint. It is the result of a successful psychological and procedural audit I was forced to conduct in order to survive. The evidence proves these were not isolated failures. They were systemic.\nI allege the following:\n* A catastrophic breach of safeguarding duty\n* Evidence tampering and data suppression\n* Gross mishandling of suicidal risk\n* Coordinated institutional minimisation\n* Potential misconduct in public office\nThe evidence is structured into three interconnected timelines:\nTimeline 1: Sussex Police\u2019s Chronology of Failure\n1. Initial Report, Dismissal, and Evidence Tampering (July \u2013 Nov 2024): On 24 July 2024, I reported Alanna O\u2019Hare for stalking, submitting a threatening audio recording. PC Gore dismissed my claim, falsely stating no threats were seen. On 7 November, PC Jon Dixon logged that he had listened to and deleted key recordings\u2014tampering with critical evidence.\n2. Victim Blaming and Procedural Breaches (Feb \u2013 Apr 2025): On 12 February 2025, Dixon committed a serious data breach by forwarding an unredacted internal police email. In March, he visited my flat to take a statement and failed to activate his Body-Worn Video (BWV). On April 22, he implied that I was the stalker for viewing a public post.\n3. Timeline Manipulation & NFA Sabotage (Apr\u2013May 2025): I was provided conflicting case start dates (Nov 12 vs July 24). On April 27, PC Dixon emailed the suspect confirming the case was NFA\u2019d \u2014two days before a high-risk MARAC safeguarding meeting was scheduled, undermining it completely.\n4. SAR Obstruction and Suicide Disclosure Neglect (Apr\u2013Jun 2025): After my suicide attempt on 6 April, it was never logged. On April 22, a 101 call handler falsely cited GDPR to block my access to case information. On June 25, the SAR team formally refused my Subject Access Request\u2014despite the case having been declared closed.\nTimeline 2: Consequential Harm and Retaliation by Brighton Fringe Ltd\n1. Safeguarding Disclosures Ignored (May 2025): On May 12, Veritas Justice formally notified Brighton Fringe of my high-risk status. No action was taken.\n2. Retaliation and Defamation: Chair Duncan Lustig-Prean accused me of defamation and demanded post deletions instead of supporting a safeguarding process.\n3. Medical Gaslighting: Fringe staff contacted my GP without my consent, falsely stating I was deluded to discredit my complaint.\n4. Narrative Control via Erasure: They took over my business branding and silenced me while continuing to platform the individual I reported.\nTimeline 3: My Personal Journey and Evidence Construction\n1. Early Engagement and Institutional Hope: I cooperated fully, seeking help from my GP and domestic abuse services.\n2. System Failure and Evidence Lockdown (April \u2013 June 2025): After learning my suicide attempt had not been logged, I began preserving every voicemail, call, and message.\n3. Formal Rights Assertion: I filed a SAR on April 8, 2025. Sussex Police acknowledged receipt, breached the statutory deadline, and then issued a last-minute refusal.\nTogether, these three timelines show how a personal experience of abuse became institutionally extended and escalated. Sussex Police buried safeguarding. Brighton Fringe buried credibility. The system buried the truth. This complaint is the result of digging it back up.\nSection 3: Thematic Analyses & Evidence Breakdowns\n3.1: From Victim to Investigator: A Case Study in Forced Self-Advocacy\nThis complaint is built upon a body of evidence whose quality is a direct result of systemic failure. The documentation herein is not the product of a well-managed process, but a testament to the resilience required to survive institutional gaslighting. I, the victim, was forced to become the chief investigator, auditor, and archivist of my own case. This section analyses the strategic approach I was compelled to adopt.\n* Strategic Navigation of Police Misconduct: My interactions with Sussex Police demonstrate a persistent and strategic effort to establish accountability. Feeling I had \"taken on the fucking police and won,\" I escalated my case to the IOPC after identifying a pattern of misconduct. This included documenting bail breaches, the failure to log a suicide attempt, and challenging PC Dixon's ongoing, inappropriate involvement in my case long after I had formally revoked his authority. My persistent follow-ups on a Subject Access Request (SAR), citing UK GDPR and copying in the IOPC, were a deliberate strategy to force transparency from an obstructive system.\n* Managing Institutional Betrayal (Brighton Fringe): I demonstrated a proactive approach to managing the complex and contradictory interactions with Brighton Fringe. I challenged their \"takeover\" vs. \"support\" narrative, documented their alleged safeguarding and data breaches, and formally withdrew my venues to ensure public safety when it became clear they would not. This was a strategic move to regain control of my business and reputation after they had attempted to erase me from their own work.\n* The Meticulous Construction of \"Courtroom-Ready\" Evidence: The documentation in this bundle is of a high standard, achieved out of necessity. I documented every interaction, created logical structures for evidence, asserted my legal rights under GDPR with precision, and used comprehensive CC lists on emails to ensure wide regulatory visibility. This was not a hobby; it was a survival tactic.\n* The Strategy of the \"Untouchable\" Victim: My communications with Sussex Police became increasingly angry and accusatory over time. This was not a loss of control; it was a deliberate strategy. I knew that any other member of the public making such damning allegations would be arrested for slander. I was able to do so because I had the evidence to prove that my \"slander\" was the truth. Their silence in the face of my escalating complaints was not a sign of my powerlessness, but of theirs. They could not arrest me, because to do so would be to trigger an investigation into themselves. They could not refute my claims, because they knew I had the recordings. Their only option was to remain silent, which in itself became the ultimate proof of their guilt. I was not being neurotic; I was untouchable.\n3.2: The 'Shared Abuse Playbook' of Institutional Violence\nThis thematic analysis details the parallel strategies of coercive control used against me by two distinct institutional actors: PC Jon Dixon of Sussex Police and Duncan Lustig-Prean, Chair of Brighton Fringe Ltd. It identifies a disturbing pattern of behaviour\u2014identical in structure and outcome\u2014executed by both individuals and the organisations they represent. The tactics used against me mirror those commonly associated with narcissistic abuse and coercive control. When applied by public authorities and charity leadership, such behaviour escalates from interpersonal harm to institutional violence. This shared \"playbook\" suggests either a coordinated effort to undermine a known victim or a shared institutional culture rooted in victim-blaming, procedural erasure, and narrative manipulation.\nThe playbook was executed in four distinct stages:\nStage 1: Silence and Stonewalling (The Provocation) Both PC Dixon and Duncan Lustig-Prean ignored repeated, urgent messages regarding my safety and case. PC Dixon failed to respond to safeguarding disclosures and evidence submissions for weeks at a time. Similarly, Mr. Lustig-Prean and the Fringe administration ignored formal safeguarding escalation emails and requests for clarification. This silence is not passive; it is an active weapon designed to provoke panic, frustration, and emotional collapse in the victim, forcing them to increase the volume and intensity of their communications simply to be heard.\nStage 2: Weaponising the Victim's Response (The Justification) The persistence that their silence necessitated was then weaponised against me. Both actors used my increased volume of emails and my distressed tone as \"evidence\" to reframe me as the problem. Brighton Fringe's formal warning of June 24, 2025, cited my \"unreasonably persistent communications\" as a form of misconduct. PC Dixon similarly reframed my attempts to get updates as harassment. This tactic punishes the victim for their predictable reaction to being ignored and rebrands distress as aggression.\nStage 3: Narrative Inversion (The Role Reversal) With a pretext established, both actors then engaged in a full narrative inversion, flipping the perpetrator-victim dynamic to position the institution as the aggrieved party.\n* PC Dixon achieved this by stating that my viewing of a public social media post by my abuser could be considered \"stalking type behaviour\u2026 from you,\" a chilling reversal that placed me under suspicion for monitoring my own abuser.\n* Brighton Fringe, led by Mr. Lustig-Prean, accused me of defamation and suggested I was unstable, framing my legitimate safeguarding reports as personal vendettas against the organisation.\nStage 4: Coordinated Medical Discrediting (The Character Assassination) The final stage was a coordinated attack on my credibility via my mental health. Brighton Fringe made contact with my GP without my consent, describing me as \"delusional and paranoid about being stalked.\" This reframed my desperate and rational pleas for help\u2014such as my recorded statement, \"You want me dead. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\"\u2014as pathology rather than a predictable response to institutional collapse and a credible threat to my life.\nParallel with the Primary Abuser: What is most disturbing is that this four-stage institutional playbook mirrors the exact tactics used by the primary abuser, Alanna O'Hare. She also ignored my requests to cease contact, provoked reactions, and then claimed harassment. Sussex Police and Brighton Fringe did not stop the abuse; they adopted its methodology and institutionalised it, becoming part of the very same machine that cornered me into collapse.\n3.3: The Leadership Vacuum: A Study in Strategic Abandonment & Scapegoating\nThis analysis asserts that the catalogue of failures documented in this complaint is not the result of rogue actions by a few junior officers, but the direct consequence of a deliberate and strategic leadership vacuum within Sussex Police. The evidence shows that senior command consistently abdicated its responsibility, creating a system where a specific, contained unit was used to manage and suppress my case, shielding the true decision-makers from accountability.\n* The \"Holiday Alibi\": A Command Structure in Self-Imposed Exile The most stark proof of this vacuum is the \"Holiday Alibi.\" Following my suicide disclosure on April 6, 2025, the entire operational chain of command for my case\u2014PC Jon Dixon, Sergeant Duffy, and Inspector Palmer\u2014was simultaneously unavailable for 17 days. This was not a coincidence; it was an organised abandonment. This coordinated absence suggests a unit that operates on a \"corrupt agenda,\" unable to integrate with other units whose focus is on genuine policing. They must take leave together because their methods would \"stand out like a sore thumb\" amongst officers engaged in actual criminal investigation. The absence of any handover proves that no senior officer reviewed the case or assigned responsibility during this critical period.\n* The Scapegoat Protocol & The \"Trust Us Machine\" The evidence suggests a systemic practice of using junior officers to absorb liability. PC Dixon was consistently left as the sole point of contact, forcing me to complain about him personally. This is the Scapegoat Protocol: it allows the force to appear to take action by investigating a frontline officer, while the cultural and systemic failures that created the situation go unaddressed. The police's claim that \"OICs get changed all the time\" is a generic deflection used to mask a more sinister reality. My officer was only changed when I forced the issue by \"shoving my human rights into their organised 'trust us' machine.\" It was my refusal to speak their jargon and my insistence on my statutory rights that broke their containment strategy.\nConclusion & Demand for Investigation: This was not a failure by PC Dixon; it was a failure of the culture and command structure above him. The gaping hole was the absence of leadership. Therefore, I demand the IOPC investigation focus not only on the conduct of the named officers but, more importantly, on:\n1. Identifying the senior officer(s) with command responsibility for this case who were on duty between April 6th and April 23rd, 2025, and failed to ensure safeguarding continuity.\n2. Auditing the decision-making process that allowed the entire command chain for a high-risk stalking victim to be on leave simultaneously without a formal, documented handover to a competent authority.\n3. Investigating the systemic use of procedural loopholes (like GDPR and leave rotas) as mechanisms for institutional avoidance and the scapegoating of junior officers.\nThe real failure is not at the bottom of this hierarchy. It is in the silence at the top.\n3.4: The 'PC Russell' Decoy: A Case Study in Institutional Misdirection\nThis was not an error. It was a calculated decoy. In May 2025, I received a formal letter stating PC Alan Russell would be my new officer for a new crime number (47250093423). He never contacted me, and PC Dixon remained on all original records. This was procedural theatre designed to create the illusion of progress and to mislead the IOPC into believing my complaints about Dixon had been addressed. My own \"invisible probe\" call on June 18th confirmed this decoy was still active in their system a month later.\n3.5: The June 22nd Collapse: A Case Study in Real-Time Institutional Abuse\nThis section dissects the sequence of events on the night of June 22, 2025. This period provides a condensed, irrefutable case study of the entire systemic failure of Sussex Police. It demonstrates a direct, causal link between a dangerous, multi-channel harassment campaign by the perpetrator and a retaliatory, abusive, and chaotic response from the police when this campaign was reported.\n* Part 1: The Coordinated Harassment Campaign: The crisis began with a sustained, multi-channel harassment campaign from Alanna O'Hare, using a new, unknown phone number (+44 7984 335531) to circumvent my attempts to block her. The evidence for this campaign, captured in a single screen-recording video, includes a barrage of missed calls, manipulative text messages, and the escalation to a new criminal offence: a malicious false allegation of rape.\n* Part 2: The Lawful Report & The Official Retraction: Recognizing the severity of this escalation, I immediately dialed 999. The call handler acknowledged the report and booked a formal video appointment. However, just hours later, at 02:48 AM, I received an email from no-reply@contact.sussex.police.uk stating this appointment was \"incorrectly booked\" and had been \"cancelled.\"\n* Part 3: The Confrontation & The Final Silencing: Armed with this written proof of their obstruction, I called 101 again. The transcripts of my subsequent calls that night document a clear pattern of retaliatory silencing, including the \"Humiliation Protocol\" (\"You're not dead, are you?\"), the weaponization of the Victim's Code, and the final refusal of service by hanging up.\nConclusion: The events of June 22nd prove, in a single, unbroken chain of events, that Sussex Police enabled a dangerous escalation, failed to respond to emergency reports, and retaliated against the victim for holding them to account.\n3.6: The Phantom MARAC: How Veritas Justice Allowed a False Hope to Persist\nThis analysis dissects the communications from my designated stalking advocate, Veritas Justice, concerning a multi-agency meeting scheduled for April 29, 2025. The evidence demonstrates that this meeting was not a formal, high-risk MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) as I was led to believe. Veritas Justice's failure to correct my use of the term \"MARAC\" was a serious act of misrepresentation by omission, which gave me a false sense of security and served to manage my expectations rather than provide genuine, transparent advocacy.\n* The Implication of a MARAC: Veritas informed me of a multi-agency meeting. Given the high-risk nature of my case, which included stalking and a recent suicide attempt, I reasonably assumed this was a formal MARAC.\n* The Failure to Correct: At no point did my advocate from Veritas Justice correct me. They allowed me to continue believing that my case was being treated with the gravity that a MARAC implies.\n* The Sabotaged Meeting: This deception is made more egregious by the fact that the meeting itself was a sham. Two days prior, on April 27th, PC Dixon had already emailed the suspect to inform her of the \"No Further Action\" decision.\nConclusion: The \"Phantom MARAC\" is a clear example of institutional gaslighting, facilitated by my own advocate.\n3.7: Indictment of Brighton Fringe Ltd: A Case Study in Institutional Retaliation and Governance Failure\nThis analysis details multiple, serious breaches of safeguarding duties, governance principles, and legal obligations by Brighton Fringe Ltd. (Charity Number: 1116367). These were not isolated errors but a systemic pattern of behaviour that created a culture where reputational management was prioritised over the charity's core mission and the safety of individuals it engaged with. These failures warrant a full investigation by the Charity Commission.\n1. Critical Breaches of Financial Governance and Trustee Independence: A review of Brighton Fringe's own financial statements reveals a disturbing lack of adherence to mandatory standards.\n* Compromised Independent Scrutiny: The most egregious breach is the fact that Duncan Lustig-Prean, the Chair of the Board of Trustees, signed his own independent examination report for the year ended 31 August 2024. This act fundamentally destroys the principle of independent external scrutiny.\n* Non-Adherence to Accounting Standards (SORP FRS 102): The independent examiner's report for the year ended 31 August 2023 explicitly states that the accounts \"have not been prepared in accordance with the methods and principles of the Statement of Recommended Practice for accounting and reporting by charities\".\n* Persistent Failure to Meet Reserves Policy: In both 2023 and 2024, the charity consistently failed to achieve its stated policy of holding reserves equivalent to three months' operational expenses.\n2. Failure to Report Serious Incidents & Weaponisation of Allegations: The \"Termination Threat\" email sent to me on June 24, 2025, provides clear evidence of a failure to adhere to legal and ethical duties.\n* Duty to Report Alleged Crimes: In the email, the Fringe levelled serious allegations against me, including potential fraud. As a registered charity, they have a legal and ethical obligation to report such concerns to the police.\n* Refusal to Report and Admission of Bad Faith: Their explicit statement in the same email\u2014\"We do not intend to involve the police\"\u2014is a confession of bad faith. It proves that the allegations were not a genuine concern for public interest, but a strategic weapon designed to silence and discredit me as a whistleblower.\nConclusion: The evidence demonstrates a pattern of serious governance failures at Brighton Fringe Ltd. I request that the Charity Commission launch a full regulatory investigation into the governance and financial management of Brighton Fringe Ltd. to determine whether the trustees are fit to govern and whether the organisation is operating in a manner consistent with its charitable status.\n3.8: The Paul Double & PC Dixon GDPR Breach\nOn February 12, 2025, PC Jon Dixon forwarded me an unredacted internal police email containing personal information about another individual, Paul Double. This was not an administrative error; it was a strategic act of intimidation. At a time when I was desperately seeking evidence to disprove a false rape allegation, this breach sent a clear message: \"We control the information, not you.\" It was designed to demonstrate police power, introduce chaos, and crush my hope of finding proof. This action constitutes a serious violation of the Data Protection Act 2018 and Misconduct in Public Office.\n3.9: The \"Crowbarring Myself Justice\" Calls (11 April 2025)\nThis event documents my own forced intervention into the record. On a single night, I made three separate 101 calls in a state of escalating distress. In these calls, I repeatedly:\n* Reiterated my suicidal state.\n* Re-submitted evidence of threats that police had claimed were \"lost.\"\n* Begged for the risk to be logged and for an officer to provide support.\nThe recordings of these calls prove that I was actively trying to force a safeguarding response from a system determined to ignore me. No welfare check or follow-up occurred. The calls are a real-time record of institutional abandonment.\n3.10: The Advocate's Gambit: Weaponising the Victim's Statement (27 April 2025)\nThis analysis dissects a recorded call from Veritas Justice on April 27, 2025. During this call, my advocate explained the police's legal strategy: to keep the false rape allegation made against me within the stalking case I had reported. The justification was that this would strengthen the case by demonstrating the \"serious alarm and distress\" caused by the stalker's campaign.\n* The Contradiction: This is not victim advocacy; it is the institutional co-opting of a victim's suffering. I was being told that to get justice for being stalked, I had to formally accept and carry the weapon being used to destroy my reputation\u2014the false rape allegation\u2014as part of my own evidence.\n* Psychological Impact: This created a paradoxical trap. The system required me to legitimize the very piece of malicious disinformation causing me the most profound harm in order to prove that I was being harmed. It is a perfect example of institutional gaslighting.\n* Conclusion: This call reveals a catastrophic failure of independent advocacy. Veritas, instead of challenging a harmful police/CPS tactic, acted as its interpreter. It proves a systemic willingness to sacrifice a victim's psychological safety and truth for the sake of prosecutorial convenience.\n3.11: The GDPR Firewall: Obstruction by Policy (22 April 2025)\nThis analysis documents the events of April 22, 2025, where I was forced to engage with both the NHS and Sussex Police 101 in a state of crisis. The recordings show two key institutional failures:\n1. The NHS Call & Cross-Contamination of Risk: After police triggered an unnecessary ambulance call-out, I disclosed to the NHS operator that Sussex Police had failed to log my previous suicide attempts. The NHS, while professional, could only log a safeguarding concern\u2014demonstrating how police inaction contaminates and burdens other public services.\n2. The 101 Call & Weaponization of GDPR: Immediately after, I contacted Sussex Police 101 to get my active crime reference number. The call handler, Jamie 44006, refused to provide this information, citing GDPR. This is a direct and unlawful inversion of data protection law, using a regulation designed to empower data subjects as a tool to disempower a victim. My assertion of my legal rights was dismissed as \"silly\" and \"demanding.\"\nThis sequence proves a systemic strategy of obstruction.\n3.12: The May 8th-9th Crisis: A Case Study in Police-Enabled Escalation and Retaliatory Silencing\nThis section dissects the events of May 8th and 9th, 2025. This 24-hour period provides a condensed, irrefutable case study of the entire systemic failure of Sussex Police. It demonstrates a direct, causal link between police negligence, a predictable escalation of harassment by the perpetrator, and a retaliatory, abusive response from the police when this escalation was reported.\n* Part 1: The Discovery of Betrayal (The Voice Note): The crisis began at 16:55 on May 9th, when I discovered that PC Dixon had secretly informed my abuser, Alanna O'Hare, that her bail conditions had been cancelled. I discovered this not from the police, but from the perpetrator herself. My immediate reaction was to send a WhatsApp voice note to my Veritas Justice advocate, a real-time record of a victim discovering a profound institutional betrayal.\n* Part 2: The Inevitable Escalation: As a direct and foreseeable consequence of being told she was no longer under any legal restraint, Alanna O'Hare immediately escalated her campaign of harassment, including the \"Guardian\" impersonation call and a series of threatening messages.\n* Part 3: The Institutional Response (A Campaign of Retaliation and Silencing): My lawful attempts to report this live crime were met not with support, but with a coordinated campaign of gaslighting, obstruction, and humiliation, documented across multiple recorded calls that night.\nConclusion: The events of May 9th prove, in a single, unbroken chain of events, that Sussex Police committed a catastrophic safeguarding breach, directly enabled a dangerous escalation of harassment, and then retaliated against the victim for holding them to account.\n3.13: The Pre-Meeting Breakdown: A Study in Co-opted Advocacy (23 April 2025)\nThis analysis covers a recorded call with my Veritas Justice advocate on April 23, 2025. The conversation reveals the strategic function Veritas had begun to play\u2014not as an independent advocate, but as a mechanism for suppressing evidence and managing my expectations on behalf of the police.\n* Evidence Suppression: The advocate explicitly states that certain police evidence summaries do not contain any mention of my suicide attempt or the false rape allegation\u2014confirming these critical facts were omitted from the official record she was working from.\n* Narrative Control: When I refuse to hand over my phone for download (citing my lack of trust), the advocate frames my refusal as a potential obstacle to the investigation, rather than a valid act of self-protection.\n* Systemic Gaslighting: Throughout the call, the advocate attempts to 'manage' my distress by deferring to police procedure, even when that procedure is the source of the harm.\nThis call demonstrates how a victim support service was co-opted to act as a buffer for police failure.\n3.14: Selective Evidence Curation \u2013 The Sanitised File\nThis analysis details one of the most insidious tactics deployed by Sussex Police: the strategic and selective curation of evidence. They deliberately retained minor, self-contained pieces of evidence while discarding the broader, more complex evidence of long-term abuse, my suicide attempt, and their own misconduct. A clear example is the handling of the false rape allegation. The police retained screenshots where the allegation is mentioned by me to a third party (Tethis). However, they ignored and failed to log the primary evidence proving its malicious and retaliatory nature, such as Alanna O'Hare's own admission on the call of June 22, 2025. By keeping the allegation but erasing its context, they curated a file that made me look unreliable and obsessed. This is not a failure to investigate; it is the construction of a false reality.\n3.15: Evidence Laundering: The False Attribution of the Google Drive Folder to NICE Links\nThis analysis dissects a critical and deliberate act of evidence manipulation by Sussex Police. The evidence proves that police did not \"lose\" my early evidence; rather, they accessed my comprehensive Google Drive folder, extracted a minor piece of information from it (a text to PC Gore), and then falsely attributed that information to a different submission channel (a NICE link) in an attempt to erase the existence of the more damning evidence contained in the original folder. This act of \"evidence laundering\" was designed to create a plausible deniability for their failure to act on the more serious evidence in the same folder. This is a direct and provable instance of bad faith and a potential conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\n3.16: The \"Dixon or Death\" Call (23 June 2025)\nThis analysis covers a recorded call to 101 on June 23, 2025, which serves as a final, damning indictment of the institutional trap created by Sussex Police. Weeks after my suicide disclosure and requests for a new officer, this call proves that nothing had changed.\n* The Inescapable Officer: When I called to find out who my \"new\" officer was, I was once again informed that PC Jon Dixon was the only officer assigned, despite my formal complaints against him and the fact he had personally blocked me on WhatsApp.\n* Weaponizing \"Case Closed\": The operator repeatedly stated my case was \"closed\" and there were \"no updates,\" using this as a justification to refuse my attempts to report new incidents of harassment.\n* The Suicide Threat Ignored Again: I explicitly reminded the call handler: \"I told Sussex Police I was suicidal and if no one got back to me by June 1st I\u2019d end my life.\" The handler's response was not a safeguarding escalation, but a continuation of procedural deflection.\nConclusion: This call is the endpoint of all other failures. It demonstrates that I was left with two options: communicate with the officer I believed was actively harming me, or be silenced entirely.\n3.17: The Police Station Visit: A Live Test of Systemic Collapse (04 July 2025)\nThis analysis covers my in-person visit to the St John's Street police station on July 4, 2025. This was not a simple inquiry; it was a deliberate, strategic test of the police's internal systems, designed to expose their administrative chaos and bad faith in a live, recorded environment. My own handwritten notes on the official police correspondence I brought with me serve as a tangible artifact of this process, demonstrating a victim forced to document institutional chaos in real-time.\nThe Strategy: A Forensic Trap After being repeatedly stonewalled on the 101 service with the excuse that my identity could not be verified under GDPR, I took the step of attending the station in person. My strategy was not to demand action, but to create an irrefutable record of their inability to perform their most basic functions.\nThe key to this strategy was my choice of identification. I presented my passport alongside the formal letter I had received assigning \"PC Alan Russell\" to my case, using this letter as my \"proof of address.\" This was a forensic trap. It forced the front desk officer, Liz, to confront a piece of official, yet fabricated, police correspondence and attempt to reconcile it with the chaotic reality of my multiple, conflicting case files.\nThe Hasty Cover-Up: A Confession in Handwriting The video recording shows the officer becoming increasingly confused as she tries to navigate the multiple crime numbers and officer assignments. The most damning evidence, however, is the photograph of her handwritten notes on the PC Russell letter.\nConfronted with information that did not match her system, she hastily crossed out an initial date before scribbling down two different crime reference numbers (47240209160 and 47240141246) with two different dates (16/10/24 and 02/11/24). This is not a simple correction; it is a live, documented cover-up. It is a physical manifestation of the police's entire strategy: when the facts don't fit the narrative, you cross them out and invent new ones. Crucially, even this hasty correction was inaccurate, as it failed to include the primary crime number for the November 2nd incident, 47240214305.\nConclusion: This in-person visit is the capstone of this complaint. It is a live, recorded, and undeniable demonstration of a system in total collapse. It proves that the multiple crime numbers, the decoy officers, the timeline manipulation, and the obstruction of my rights are not a figment of my imagination, but a documented reality. The police's inability to answer the most basic questions about my case, even when confronted with their own contradictory documents, is the final proof of their profound and systemic failure.\n3.18: The \"Lost\" Voicemail & The Recorded Lie (March - May 2025)\nThis analysis dissects a critical sequence of events that proves a deliberate attempt by Duncan Lustig-Prean, Chair of Brighton Fringe, to erase a formal safeguarding disclosure from the record by knowingly making a false statement.\n* Part 1: The Safeguarding Disclosure (The Voicemail): On March 21, 2025, I left a voicemail for Brighton Fringe regarding a potential conflict and risk involving another venue manager, Alexander Voodoo. Crucially, I have a full audio recording of this voicemail being left, proving its existence and its content beyond any doubt.\n* Part 2: The Denial from Brighton Fringe (The Lie): On May 4, 2025, after weeks of silence, I followed up with Duncan Lustig-Prean via email. He made a definitive and demonstrably false claim: \"No answer phone message has been received and any messages which were received in that period will now have been overwritten.\" The existence of the audio recording of the voicemail makes this statement a provable lie.\nConclusion: This is not a case of a lost message or a faulty answering machine. This is a case of a senior charity leader being confronted with a formal safeguarding disclosure, ignoring it for over a month, and then, when challenged, lying about its existence to avoid accountability.\n3.19: The Crime Reference Disposal Loop (04 May 2025)\nThis analysis dissects an email exchange on May 4, 2025, which proves a consistent pattern of deflection and institutional gaslighting by Duncan Lustig-Prean, Chair of Brighton Fringe. This \"Crime Reference Disposal Loop\" demonstrates a deliberate strategy to avoid accountability by feigning ignorance and disavowing responsibility, even when presented with formal, official information.\n* The Loop in Action: The exchange began with me formally providing a police crime reference number. Mr. Lustig-Prean's response was a multi-stage deflection, moving from \"What do you want me to do with this crime reference?\" to a minimalist acknowledgement, and finally to a complete disavowal: \"Brighton Fringe has nothing to do with the legal matters pertaining to Ben Carter.\"\nConclusion: This sequence is a textbook example of institutional stonewalling, designed to exhaust the complainant and create a false narrative of non-involvement for the official record.\n3.20: \"I\u2019m Not Operational Staff \u2013 Except When I Am\": A Case Study in Role Obfuscation\nThis analysis dissects a key tactic of institutional deflection employed by Duncan Lustig-Prean: the strategic use of his \"non-operational\" status as a shield to avoid accountability. The evidence proves that he would simultaneously claim to be powerless while acting as the ultimate authority, depending on what best served the institution's interest of deflecting responsibility.\n* The Contradiction: Within the same conversation, Mr. Lustig-Prean stated: \"I am Chair of the organisation not operational staff...\" while also confirming he was preparing a legal statement for the police and that my relationship with the Fringe was under his \"personal review.\" He cannot be both a non-operational figurehead and the sole, authoritative voice of the institution.\nConclusion: Duncan Lustig-Prean's claim to be \"not operational\" is a fiction, a convenient shield to be deployed when faced with his legal and ethical duties.\n3.21: The \"Fringe Hub Deflection\": A Case Study in Reckless Safeguarding Advice\nThis analysis dissects a dangerous and negligent pattern of advice given to me by Duncan Lustig-Prean on May 4, 2025. After I had disclosed that I was in hiding due to threats from my stalker and her associates, Mr. Lustig-Prean repeatedly instructed me to physically visit a public space\u2014the Artist Hub at the Theatre Royal\u2014to resolve my issues. This was not just unhelpful advice; it was a reckless and profound safeguarding failure.\n* The Deflection in Action: The email thread from May 4th shows him repeating this dangerous advice three times, ignoring the context of my fear for my physical safety.\n* The Irreconcilable Contradiction: This advice was given in the same email thread where I had submitted a formal police crime reference number. His instruction to go to a public place, rather than offering a secure channel of communication, is a textbook example of a catastrophic safeguarding breach.\nConclusion: This was not just bad advice; it was dangerous advice. It proves that Duncan Lustig-Prean and Brighton Fringe either had no understanding of their basic safeguarding duties or chose to ignore them in favour of a convenient operational deflection.\n3.22: \"No Safeguarding Officer Appointed\": A Case Study in Structural Negligence\nThis analysis details a fundamental and systemic governance failure at the heart of Brighton Fringe Ltd.: the complete absence of a clear, accessible, and functioning safeguarding protocol. Despite being a registered charity with a duty of care to thousands of participants, the evidence proves that when faced with a direct safeguarding disclosure, the organisation had no named officer, no clear reporting pathway, and no process for handling the concern.\n* The Direct Question and The Evasion: On May 4, 2025, I asked a direct and simple question to the Chair of the Board, Duncan Lustig-Prean: \"Who within the Fringe organisation is responsible for ensuring these matters are correctly recorded and acted upon?\" The response was not an answer, but a complete shutdown of the conversation.\n* The Legal Requirement for Accountability: The Charity Commission's official safeguarding guidance is unequivocal. It requires all charities to have \"clear lines of accountability and reporting for safeguarding concerns.\" Brighton Fringe's failure to provide this, even when asked directly, is a serious breach of this duty.\nConclusion: The evidence proves that Brighton Fringe did not just fail to follow its safeguarding policy; it appears not to have had a functional one in the first place.\n3.23: The \"Legal Firewall\" Lie: A Case Study in False Separation\nThis analysis dissects a key tactic of institutional deflection employed by Duncan Lustig-Prean: the creation of a fictional \"legal firewall\" to disavow responsibility for a safeguarding crisis. The evidence proves that he repeatedly stated that Brighton Fringe had \"nothing to do\" with the legal matters I raised, in direct contradiction to his prior involvement in handling crime references and safeguarding disclosures.\n* The Contradiction: Within the same conversation on May 4, 2025, Mr. Lustig-Prean both acknowledged and engaged with a police crime reference number and then later claimed: \"Brighton Fringe has nothing to do with the legal matters pertaining to Ben Carter.\"\n* The Strategic Purpose of the Firewall: This is a deliberate governance lie, designed to create a false jurisdiction gap, leaving the victim unsupported by either the Fringe or the police.\nConclusion: Duncan Lustig-Prean's creation of a \"legal firewall\" is a fiction, a convenient shield to be deployed when faced with his legal and ethical duties.\n3.24: The \"Managing Director Phantom\": A Case Study in False Assurance\nThis analysis dissects a key tactic of institutional deflection employed by Duncan Lustig-Prean: the invocation of a \"phantom\" Managing Director (MD) to create the illusion of oversight and process where none existed. The evidence proves that he repeatedly referenced the involvement of an MD who was never named, never made contact, and who appears to have been used solely as a rhetorical shield to deflect responsibility.\n* The Contradiction: Mr. Lustig-Prean stated: \"The relationship between Brighton Fringe and Ben Carter is under the personal review of the managing director and Chair.\" Despite this claim, at no point in any subsequent communication did a Managing Director ever appear.\n* The Strategic Purpose of the Phantom: This is a form of institutional gaslighting, designed to create a false assurance of oversight and a disempowering escalation path for the victim.\nConclusion: The \"Managing Director Phantom\" is a clear example of how institutional language can be used to create a smokescreen of due process.\n3.25: \"Who Knew What, When \u2013 And Still Did Nothing\": An Analysis of Multi-Agency Failure\nThis analysis details how all three key parties\u2014Sussex Police, Brighton Fringe Ltd., and the perpetrator, Alanna O'Hare\u2014were fully aware of the escalating safeguarding risks, yet each deferred responsibility, creating a shared-but-ignored crisis where my disclosures were acknowledged in fragments, but no single agency coordinated a duty-of-care response.\n* Timeline of Awareness: The evidence proves that by May 2025, all three parties were fully aware of the risks.\n* The Coordinated Evasion Circuit: All parties were relying on the existence of the others to justify their own inaction, creating a perfect loop of institutional failure:\n   * The Fringe's Defence: \"This is a police matter, take it to them.\"\n   * The Police's Defence: \"This is a civil/Fringe matter, we can't get involved without them.\"\n   * The Perpetrator's Action: Exploits the resulting silence and paralysis to escalate her campaign of harassment.\nConclusion: This was a shared crisis that was deliberately ignored.\n3.26: \"The Gaslight Relay\": A Case Study in Multi-Agency Deflection\nThis analysis dissects the primary mechanism of institutional abuse I faced: a \"Gaslight Relay.\" This is a process where multiple, supposedly independent agencies create a closed loop of perpetual deferral, each pointing to the other as the \"correct\" authority, effectively trapping the victim in a bureaucratic no-man's-land where no one takes responsibility.\n* The Mechanics of the Relay: The evidence proves a consistent pattern of deflection across all three key institutions: Brighton Fringe, Sussex Police, and Veritas Justice.\n* The Psychological Impact: Induced Confusion: This institutional passing of the baton is a form of gaslighting, designed to make the victim question their own judgment and sanity.\nConclusion: The Gaslight Relay was the engine of my institutional abuse.\n3.27: \"Letting Her Write the Story\": A Case Study in Narrative Adoption\nThis analysis details one of the most insidious forms of institutional abuse I faced: the consistent and systemic failure of Sussex Police, Brighton Fringe, and Veritas Justice to challenge the false narrative of my abuser, Alanna O'Hare. Their collective inaction and deflection did not just create a vacuum of support; it actively empowered the perpetrator by treating her version of events as valid, or at least, uncontested. This is not just a failure to protect; it is a structural reinforcement of an abuser's lies.\n* The Pattern of Complicity: The evidence shows a clear pattern where my evidence was dismissed while her narrative was allowed to flourish.\n* The Psychological Inversion: The consequence of this collective failure was a complete psychological inversion of my reality. I, the victim, was forced into the position of having to constantly prove my own sanity and the truth of my experience, while my abuser was treated as a credible, if troubled, party.\nConclusion: The failure to challenge an abuser's lies is a form of complicity.\n3.28: The Final Confirmation: A Written Confession of Systemic Neglect (06 July 2025)\nThis analysis covers a text message received from PC Aaron Gasson on July 6, 2025. This message is a formal, written admission of the systemic neglect that lies at the heart of this complaint.\n* The Confession: The most critical line in the message is this: \"I am aware that you wish for an update which you have not received one in some time.\" This is a formal acknowledgement from a serving police officer that they have knowingly and for a prolonged period failed to adhere to their statutory duty to keep a victim of crime informed.\n* The Continuation of the Scapegoat Protocol: The text confirms that PC Gasson is the \"new Officer in charge,\" passed on from a \"different officer.\" This proves that the strategy of simply swapping out frontline officers while keeping the compromised supervisory structure (i.e., Sergeant Duffy) in place is ongoing.\nConclusion: This text message is the final, irrefutable piece of evidence in this case. It is a written receipt for three months of systemic neglect.\n3.29: The Culture of Complicity: A Final Analysis of Motive\nThis final analysis moves beyond documenting individual failures to expose the underlying cultural rot that makes such failures not just possible, but inevitable. The actions of the officers and partner agencies involved in my case are not necessarily the product of individual malevolence, but of a toxic institutional culture that enables and normalises harmful conduct through well-documented psychological mechanisms.\n* The \"Banality of Evil\" and Institutional Conformity: The pattern of behaviour observed within Sussex Police aligns with the concept of the \"banality of evil,\" where ordinary people, by conforming blindly to group expectations, can become agents of harm.\n* The Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement: This culture of complicity is maintained through several key psychological mechanisms:\n   * Redefining Harmful Conduct: The police consistently reframed their actions using \"sanitising language.\"\n   * Displacement of Responsibility: The \"Scapegoat Protocol\" is a textbook example of this mechanism.\n   * Minimising Harm and Dehumanisation: It is easier to harm others when their suffering is not visible and victims are \"dehumanised and blamed.\"\nConclusion: The system did not fail because of a few bad officers. It failed because the culture of the unit assigned to my case was fundamentally incompatible with the principles of justice, safeguarding, and basic human decency.\nSection 4: Works Cited\n(A full list of the 58 sources and evidence files will be appended here, corresponding to the references throughout the full evidence bund\n Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), The Charity Commission for England and Wales From: Ben Carter Date: 11 July 2025 Subject: Formal Complaint: Systemic Negligence, Misconduct in Public Office, and Coordinated Institutional Abuse by Sussex Police & Brighton Fringe Ltd. Case References: 47240141246, 47240214305, CIT1201684\nSection 1: Complainant\u2019s Foreword\nOn 22 June 2025, I informed Sussex Police that this IOPC complaint was being submitted immediately. What followed was a desperate and panicked attempt to cover their tracks. Brighton Fringe acted within an hour. Veritas Justice followed the next day. It is now clear that Professional Standards is being positioned as the next scapegoat \u2014 part of a last-ditch effort to regain control.\nJust before I submitted this bundle, Sussex Police broke the law again. Their SAR refusal \u2014 sent in direct contradiction of their own case closure \u2014 was not just unlawful. It was strategic. They are trying to prevent me from accessing what I \u2014 and they \u2014 already know.\nThat refusal email fits neatly into this evidence bundle. Because unlike them, I do not need a smoking gun. The lack of evidence, the obstruction, and the contradictory timelines are the proof.\nThis is a group that is scared. Their mistake was not in underestimating my intelligence \u2014 but in underestimating a victim who began with only a basic knowledge of the law and a moral instinct to demand what was right. They did not expect a victim to act with instinctive clarity \u2014 guided not by training, but by a basic understanding of justice, and a demand for the respect every victim deserves.\nMy journey began with a single, defiant plea: \"police please.\" I was met with silence. But once I learned how they operate, I mapped the hierarchy clearly: the OIC, PC Dixon. His Sergeant, Duffy. Their Inspector, Palmer. And above them \u2014 nothing but the empty promises of Chief Constable Jo Shiner and her automated voice offering \u201cspecially trained staff\u201d that never materialised.\nBy aligning this broken structure with the human rights they were sworn to uphold, I was able to expose their failures. This evidence bundle documents those failures in full.\nThis bundle does not ask for belief. It provides proof. Where they chose silence, I created record. Where they deleted, I preserved. And where they tried to erase the victim \u2014 I wrote the history myself.\nWhat I have been through was harrowing. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of all the people who didn\u2019t get the opportunity I had\u2014the opportunity of a second life. This is what has driven my case. It has nothing to do with me. By all rights, I shouldn\u2019t be here to write this. I hate to think how many aren't.\nThis complaint is for them. It has been terrifying, but my hope is that it brings closure for their loved ones and helps to stop this from ever happening again. That is how I not just got through this; it is why I always would have\u2014because of them.\nSection 2: The Core Complaint & Timeline of Failures\nThis is not a complaint of poor service \u2014 it is a report of coordinated institutional failure. I am lodging this formal complaint to detail a series of systemic safeguarding breaches by Sussex Police, and to formally trigger my Victim\u2019s Right to Review (VRR) of the No Further Action (NFA) decision communicated to the suspect in my stalking case\u2014without informing me.\nThis is not a standard complaint. It is the result of a successful psychological and procedural audit I was forced to conduct in order to survive. The evidence proves these were not isolated failures. They were systemic.\nI allege the following:\n* A catastrophic breach of safeguarding duty\n* Evidence tampering and data suppression\n* Gross mishandling of suicidal risk\n* Coordinated institutional minimisation\n* Potential misconduct in public office\nThe evidence is structured into three interconnected timelines:\nTimeline 1: Sussex Police\u2019s Chronology of Failure\n1. Initial Report, Dismissal, and Evidence Tampering (July \u2013 Nov 2024): On 24 July 2024, I reported Alanna O\u2019Hare for stalking, submitting a threatening audio recording. PC Gore dismissed my claim, falsely stating no threats were seen. On 7 November, PC Jon Dixon logged that he had listened to and deleted key recordings\u2014tampering with critical evidence.\n2. Victim Blaming and Procedural Breaches (Feb \u2013 Apr 2025): On 12 February 2025, Dixon committed a serious data breach by forwarding an unredacted internal police email. In March, he visited my flat to take a statement and failed to activate his Body-Worn Video (BWV). On April 22, he implied that I was the stalker for viewing a public post.\n3. Timeline Manipulation & NFA Sabotage (Apr\u2013May 2025): I was provided conflicting case start dates (Nov 12 vs July 24). On April 27, PC Dixon emailed the suspect confirming the case was NFA\u2019d \u2014two days before a high-risk MARAC safeguarding meeting was scheduled, undermining it completely.\n4. SAR Obstruction and Suicide Disclosure Neglect (Apr\u2013Jun 2025): After my suicide attempt on 6 April, it was never logged. On April 22, a 101 call handler falsely cited GDPR to block my access to case information. On June 25, the SAR team formally refused my Subject Access Request\u2014despite the case having been declared closed.\nTimeline 2: Consequential Harm and Retaliation by Brighton Fringe Ltd\n1. Safeguarding Disclosures Ignored (May 2025): On May 12, Veritas Justice formally notified Brighton Fringe of my high-risk status. No action was taken.\n2. Retaliation and Defamation: Chair Duncan Lustig-Prean accused me of defamation and demanded post deletions instead of supporting a safeguarding process.\n3. Medical Gaslighting: Fringe staff contacted my GP without my consent, falsely stating I was deluded to discredit my complaint.\n4. Narrative Control via Erasure: They took over my business branding and silenced me while continuing to platform the individual I reported.\nTimeline 3: My Personal Journey and Evidence Construction\n1. Early Engagement and Institutional Hope: I cooperated fully, seeking help from my GP and domestic abuse services.\n2. System Failure and Evidence Lockdown (April \u2013 June 2025): After learning my suicide attempt had not been logged, I began preserving every voicemail, call, and message.\n3. Formal Rights Assertion: I filed a SAR on April 8, 2025. Sussex Police acknowledged receipt, breached the statutory deadline, and then issued a last-minute refusal.\nTogether, these three timelines show how a personal experience of abuse became institutionally extended and escalated. Sussex Police buried safeguarding. Brighton Fringe buried credibility. The system buried the truth. This complaint is the result of digging it back up.\nSection 3: Thematic Analyses & Evidence Breakdowns\n(All sections from 3.1 to 3.83 are included here as previously written)\n3.84: The Forensic Architecture of the Evidence: A Guide for Investigators\nThis complaint is not a simple collection of files. It is a self-prosecuting forensic architecture, designed to be navigated intuitively. The structure itself is part of the evidence, proving a pattern of systemic failure before a single document is opened. This section serves as the guide for any investigator reviewing the accompanying evidence bundle.\nCore Principle: Structure as Proof The evidence is organised to tell a story of escalating neglect and corruption. The folder names, the chronological ordering, and the visual tagging system are all designed to make the connections between different institutional failures undeniable.\n1. The Folder Naming Convention: \"Emoji Breadcrumbs\" Each key folder is named using a \"breadcrumb\" system of emojis that allows an investigator to understand its content at a glance. The structure is as follows:\n[Failure Type] [Date/Period] [Status]\n* Example: \ud83d\udcc1 \ud83d\udd35 Sussex Police \ud83d\udd34 Contradiction \ud83d\udcc6 July 2024 \ud83d\udea8 No Response This title immediately tells the reviewer that this folder contains evidence of a contradiction involving Sussex Police, related to events in July 2024, to which there has been no response.\n2. The Visual Tagging System: A Forensic Language A simple, consistent set of emojis is used to tag every piece of evidence, providing multiple layers of context. A full key is provided in the README_TAG_KEY.txt file in the root of the evidence bundle.\n* Institutional Codes:\n   * \ud83d\udd35 Sussex Police\n   * \ud83d\udfe3 Brighton Fringe\n   * \ud83d\udfe0 Veritas Justice\n   * \u2716 Perpetrator (Alanna O'Hare)\n* Functional Tags:\n   * \ud83d\udd34 Contradiction: The evidence in this folder proves a direct contradiction.\n   *  Legal Threshold Met: The evidence meets the criteria for a specific legal or statutory breach.\n   * \ud83d\udea8 Ignored Safeguarding Disclosure: This folder contains a formal safeguarding or suicide disclosure that was ignored.\n   * \ud83e\udde0 Psychological Impact: This folder contains a psych.txt file detailing the emotional harm caused at that point in the timeline.\n   * \ud83d\udcce Cross-Linked: This evidence is directly linked to another piece of evidence in a different folder.\n   * \u2b50 Showcase Entry: This is a primary, \"smoking gun\" piece of evidence.\n3. The Internal File Structure: The \"Justice Vault\" Every major evidence folder is a self-contained \"prosecutorial bundle,\" containing a standard set of files:\n* README.txt: A brief summary of what the folder proves, which laws were breached, and which other evidence clusters it links to.\n* psych.txt: A first-person account of my emotional and psychological state at the time of the event.\n* evidence.pdf / .mp3 / .png: The core evidence file(s).\n* submitted_to.txt: A record of which institution received this evidence and when.\n* response_or_not.txt: A log of the response, or lack thereof.\nConclusion: This system is designed to eliminate ambiguity and to prevent the very \"manufactured confusion\" that Sussex Police and its partners used to obstruct this case. It is a guided tour of institutional failure. It does not ask you to connect the dots; it presents you with a map where the lines have already been drawn.To: The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), The Charity Commission for England and Wales From: Ben Carter Date: 11 July 2025 Subject: Formal Complaint: Systemic Negligence, Misconduct in Public Office, and Coordinated Institutional Abuse by Sussex Police & Brighton Fringe Ltd. Case References: 47240141246, 47240214305, CIT1201684\nSection 1: Complainant\u2019s Foreword\nOn July 21st, 2024, after four years of being gaslit and seeing my life through someone else's eyes, I made my first call for help. I said, \"Police, please.\" I was met with a silence that would last for a year, a silence that would push me to the very brink of my life.\nThis complaint documents what happens when a victim of crime is not just ignored, but is actively and systematically erased by the very institutions that are supposed to protect them. The evidence within this bundle will prove, beyond any doubt, a coordinated institutional failure by Sussex Police and its partner agencies. It will detail evidence tampering, catastrophic safeguarding breaches, and a culture of complicity that chose to protect itself rather than protect a human life.\nBut this is not just a story of my own survival. It is a story about my friend, Kim Box.\nThe same pattern of institutional failure, the same confusion, the same dismissal that I experienced, is exactly how Kim died. She was failed by the same police force. When I found myself on the same path, feeling the same despair and the same hopelessness, I knew I had a choice. I could become another statistic, another victim whose family would be left with nothing but questions.\nOr I could fight.\nI would never have ended my life. Not because I wasn't pushed to that edge\u2014I was. But because of Amy, and because of my little Milena, whose own mother is now looking after Kim's 13-year-old daughter who found her mother dead. I could not let that happen again. I could not let that snowball of grief and unanswered questions crush another family.\nSo I made a decision. I would not just survive; I would document my survival. I would walk the path they laid for Kim, but I would record every step, every lie, every failure. I would become the witness she never had.\nWhat I have been through was harrowing. But this complaint is not just for me. It is for Kim. It is for every victim whose last words were \"police, please,\" and who was met with silence. It is for their families, who deserve the closure of knowing that someone, finally, is holding this broken system to account.\nFinally, I want to be clear about the nature of this submission. I am aware of the gravity of the claims I am making, and I would not take this opportunity to put forward any opinion-based or conspiracist claims that are not completely backed by evidence. These are not opinions; they are documented facts.\nI am aware that it is in the interest of Sussex Police to frame me as an annoyance who should not be taken seriously. But I have full respect for the law when it is enforced correctly, and I am proud to live in a country where the police can be policed. The reason I am escalating this to you is because I have been left with no other choice. I currently have no access to emergency services and cannot leave my house. Daily, Sussex Police are changing crime numbers and dates. The Crown Prosecution Service has never heard of me.\nI am alerting you now that I am making a rational decision, because that is what I am. I am living in a world that has been made unsustainable by what these institutions have subjected me to. They think I am the victim. I am not. I feel I have a duty to stop what I have already proved has been hidden from you.\nSection 2: The Core Complaint & Timeline of Failures\nThis is not a complaint of poor service \u2014 it is a report of coordinated institutional failure. I am lodging this formal complaint to detail a series of systemic safeguarding breaches by Sussex Police, and to formally trigger my Victim\u2019s Right to Review (VRR) of the No Further Action (NFA) decision communicated to the suspect in my stalking case\u2014without informing me.\nThis is not a standard complaint.

Formal Rights Assertion: I filed a SAR on April 8, 2025. Sussex Police acknowledged receipt, breached the statutory deadline, and then issued a last-minute refusal.\nTogether, these three timelines show how a personal experience of abuse became institutionally extended and escalated. Sussex Police buried safeguarding. Brighton Fringe buried credibility. The system buried the truth. This complaint is the result of digging it back up.\nSection 3: Thematic Analyses & Evidence Breakdowns\n3.1: From Victim to Investigator: A Case Study in Forced Self-Advocacy\nThis complaint is built upon a body of evidence whose quality is a direct result of systemic failure. The documentation herein is not the product of a well-managed process, but a testament to the resilience required to survive institutional gaslighting. I, the victim, was forced to become the chief investigator, auditor, and archivist of my own case. This section analyses the strategic approach I was compelled to adopt.\n* Strategic Navigation of Police Misconduct: My interactions with Sussex Police demonstrate a persistent and strategic effort to establish accountability. Feeling I had \"taken on the fucking police and won,\" I escalated my case to the IOPC after identifying a pattern of misconduct. This included documenting bail breaches, the failure to log a suicide attempt, and challenging PC Dixon's ongoing, inappropriate involvement in my case long after I had formally revoked his authority. My persistent follow-ups on a Subject Access Request (SAR), citing UK GDPR and copying in the IOPC, were a deliberate strategy to force transparency from an obstructive system.\n* Managing Institutional Betrayal (Brighton Fringe): I demonstrated a proactive approach to managing the complex and contradictory interactions with Brighton Fringe. I challenged their \"takeover\" vs. \"support\" narrative, documented their alleged safeguarding and data breaches, and formally withdrew my venues to ensure public safety when it became clear they would not. This was a strategic move to regain control of my business and reputation after they had attempted to erase me from their own work.\n* The Meticulous Construction of \"Courtroom-Ready\" Evidence: The documentation in this bundle is of a high standard, achieved out of necessity. I documented every interaction, created logical structures for evidence, asserted my legal rights under GDPR with precision, and used comprehensive CC lists on emails to ensure wide regulatory visibility. This was not a hobby; it was a survival tactic.\n* The Strategy of the \"Untouchable\" Victim: My communications with Sussex Police became increasingly angry and accusatory over time. This was not a loss of control; it was a deliberate strategy. I knew that any other member of the public making such damning allegations would be arrested for slander. I was able to do so because I had the evidence to prove that my \"slander\" was the truth. Their silence in the face of my escalating complaints was not a sign of my powerlessness, but of theirs. They could not arrest me, because to do so would be to trigger an investigation into themselves. They could not refute my claims, because they knew I had the recordings. Their only option was to remain silent, which in itself became the ultimate proof of their guilt. I was not being neurotic; I was untouchable.\n3.2: The 'Shared Abuse Playbook' of Institutional Violence\nThis thematic analysis details the parallel strategies of coercive control used against me by two distinct institutional actors: PC Jon Dixon of Sussex Police and Duncan Lustig-Prean, Chair of Brighton Fringe Ltd. It identifies a disturbing pattern of behaviour\u2014identical in structure and outcome\u2014executed by both individuals and the organisations they represent. The tactics used against me mirror those commonly associated with narcissistic abuse and coercive control. When applied by public authorities and charity leadership, such behaviour escalates from interpersonal harm to institutional violence. This shared \"playbook\" suggests either a coordinated effort to undermine a known victim or a shared institutional culture rooted in victim-blaming, procedural erasure, and narrative manipulation.\nThe playbook was executed in four distinct stages:\nStage 1: Silence and Stonewalling (The Provocation) Both PC Dixon and Duncan Lustig-Prean ignored repeated, urgent messages regarding my safety and case. PC Dixon failed to respond to safeguarding disclosures and evidence submissions for weeks at a time. Similarly, Mr. Lustig-Prean and the Fringe administration ignored formal safeguarding escalation emails and requests for clarification. This silence is not passive; it is an active weapon designed to provoke panic, frustration, and emotional collapse in the victim, forcing them to increase the volume and intensity of their communications simply to be heard.\nStage 2: Weaponising the Victim's Response (The Justification) The persistence that their silence necessitated was then weaponised against me. Both actors used my increased volume of emails and my distressed tone as \"evidence\" to reframe me as the problem. Brighton Fringe's formal warning of June 24, 2025, cited my \"unreasonably persistent communications\" as a form of misconduct. PC Dixon similarly reframed my attempts to get updates as harassment. This tactic punishes the victim for their predictable reaction to being ignored and rebrands distress as aggression.\nStage 3: Narrative Inversion (The Role Reversal) With a pretext established, both actors then engaged in a full narrative inversion, flipping the perpetrator-victim dynamic to position the institution as the aggrieved party.\n* PC Dixon achieved this by stating that my viewing of a public social media post by my abuser could be considered \"stalking type behaviour\u2026 from you,\" a chilling reversal that placed me under suspicion for monitoring my own abuser.\n* Brighton Fringe, led by Mr. Lustig-Prean, accused me of defamation and suggested I was unstable, framing my legitimate safeguarding reports as personal vendettas against the organisation.\nStage 4: Coordinated Medical Discrediting (The Character Assassination) The final stage was a coordinated attack on my credibility via my mental health. Brighton Fringe made contact with my GP without my consent, describing me as \"delusional and paranoid about being stalked.\" This reframed my desperate and rational pleas for help\u2014such as my recorded statement, \"You want me dead. That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\"\u2014as pathology rather than a predictable response to institutional collapse and a credible threat to my life.\nParallel with the Primary Abuser: What is most disturbing is that this four-stage institutional playbook mirrors the exact tactics used by the primary abuser, Alanna O'Hare. She also ignored my requests to cease contact, provoked reactions, and then claimed harassment. Sussex Police and Brighton Fringe did not stop the abuse; they adopted its methodology and institutionalised it, becoming part of the very same machine that cornered me into collapse.\n3.3: The Leadership Vacuum: A Study in Strategic Abandonment & Scapegoating\nThis analysis asserts that the catalogue of failures documented in this complaint is not the result of rogue actions by a few junior officers, but the direct consequence of a deliberate and strategic leadership vacuum within Sussex Police. The evidence shows that senior command consistently abdicated its responsibility, creating a system where a specific, contained unit was used to manage and suppress my case, shielding the true decision-makers from accountability.\n* The \"Holiday Alibi\": A Command Structure in Self-Imposed Exile The most stark proof of this vacuum is the \"Holiday Alibi.\" Following my suicide disclosure on April 6, 2025, the entire operational chain of command for my case\u2014PC Jon Dixon, Sergeant Duffy, and Inspector Palmer\u2014was simultaneously unavailable for 17 days. This was not a coincidence; it was an organised abandonment. This coordinated absence suggests a unit that operates on a \"corrupt agenda,\" unable to integrate with other units whose focus is on genuine policing. They must take leave together because their methods would \"stand out like a sore thumb\" amongst officers engaged in actual criminal investigation. The absence of any handover proves that no senior officer reviewed the case or assigned responsibility during this critical period.\n* The Scapegoat Protocol & The \"Trust Us Machine\" The evidence suggests a systemic practice of using junior officers to absorb liability. PC Dixon was consistently left as the sole point of contact, forcing me to complain about him personally. This is the Scapegoat Protocol: it allows the force to appear to take action by investigating a frontline officer, while the cultural and systemic failures that created the situation go unaddressed. The police's claim that \"OICs get changed all the time\" is a generic deflection used to mask a more sinister reality. My officer was only changed when I forced the issue by \"shoving my human rights into their organised 'trust us' machine.\" It was my refusal to speak their jargon and my insistence on my statutory rights that broke their containment strategy.\nConclusion & Demand for Investigation: This was not a failure by PC Dixon; it was a failure of the culture and command structure above him. The gaping hole was the absence of leadership. Therefore, I demand the IOPC investigation focus not only on the conduct of the named officers but, more importantly, on:\n1. Identifying the senior officer(s) with command responsibility for this case who were on duty between April 6th and April 23rd, 2025, and failed to ensure safeguarding continuity.\n2. Auditing the decision-making process that allowed the entire command chain for a high-risk stalking victim to be on leave simultaneously without a formal, documented handover to a competent authority.\n3. Investigating the systemic use of procedural loopholes (like GDPR and leave rotas) as mechanisms for institutional avoidance and the scapegoating of junior officers.\nThe real failure is not at the bottom of this hierarchy. It is in the silence at the top.\n3.4: The 'PC Russell' Decoy: A Case Study in Institutional Misdirection\nThis was not an error. It was a calculated decoy. In May 2025, I received a formal letter stating PC Alan Russell would be my new officer for a new crime number (47250093423). He never contacted me, and PC Dixon remained on all original records. This was procedural theatre designed to create the illusion of progress and to mislead the IOPC into believing my complaints about Dixon had been addressed. My own \"invisible probe\" call on June 18th confirmed this decoy was still active in their system a month later.\n3.5: The June 22nd Collapse: A Case Study in Real-Time Institutional Abuse\nThis section dissects the sequence of events on the night of June 22, 2025. This period provides a condensed, irrefutable case study of the entire systemic failure of Sussex Police. It demonstrates a direct, causal link between a dangerous, multi-channel harassment campaign by the perpetrator and a retaliatory, abusive, and chaotic response from the police when this campaign was reported.\n* Part 1: The Coordinated Harassment Campaign: The crisis began with a sustained, multi-channel harassment campaign from Alanna O'Hare, using a new, unknown phone number (+44 7984 335531) to circumvent my attempts to block her. The evidence for this campaign, captured in a single screen-recording video, includes a barrage of missed calls, manipulative text messages, and the escalation to a new criminal offence: a malicious false allegation of rape.\n* Part 2: The Lawful Report & The Official Retraction: Recognizing the severity of this escalation, I immediately dialed 999. The call handler acknowledged the report and booked a formal video appointment. However, just hours later, at 02:48 AM, I received an email from no-reply@contact.sussex.police.uk stating this appointment was \"incorrectly booked\" and had been \"cancelled.\"\n* Part 3: The Confrontation & The Final Silencing: Armed with this written proof of their obstruction, I called 101 again. The transcripts of my subsequent calls that night document a clear pattern of retaliatory silencing, including the \"Humiliation Protocol\" (\"You're not dead, are you?\"), the weaponization of the Victim's Code, and the final refusal of service by hanging up.\nConclusion: The events of June 22nd prove, in a single, unbroken chain of events, that Sussex Police enabled a dangerous escalation, failed to respond to emergency reports, and retaliated against the victim for holding them to account.\n3.6: The Phantom MARAC: How Veritas Justice Allowed a False Hope to Persist\nThis analysis dissects the communications from my designated stalking advocate, Veritas Justice, concerning a multi-agency meeting scheduled for April 29, 2025. The evidence demonstrates that this meeting was not a formal, high-risk MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) as I was led to believe. Veritas Justice's failure to correct my use of the term \"MARAC\" was a serious act of misrepresentation by omission, which gave me a false sense of security and served to manage my expectations rather than provide genuine, transparent advocacy.\n* The Implication of a MARAC: Veritas informed me of a multi-agency meeting. Given the high-risk nature of my case, which included stalking and a recent suicide attempt, I reasonably assumed this was a formal MARAC.\n* The Failure to Correct: At no point did my advocate from Veritas Justice correct me. They allowed me to continue believing that my case was being treated with the gravity that a MARAC implies.\n* The Sabotaged Meeting: This deception is made more egregious by the fact that the meeting itself was a sham. Two days prior, on April 27th, PC Dixon had already emailed the suspect to inform her of the \"No Further Action\" decision.\nConclusion: The \"Phantom MARAC\" is a clear example of institutional gaslighting, facilitated by my own advocate.\n3.7: Indictment of Brighton Fringe Ltd: A Case Study in Institutional Retaliation and Governance Failure\nThis analysis details multiple, serious breaches of safeguarding duties, governance principles, and legal obligations by Brighton Fringe Ltd. (Charity Number: 1116367). These were not isolated errors but a systemic pattern of behaviour that created a culture where reputational management was prioritised over the charity's core mission and the safety of individuals it engaged with. These failures warrant a full investigation by the Charity Commission.\n1. Critical Breaches of Financial Governance and Trustee Independence: A review of Brighton Fringe's own financial statements reveals a disturbing lack of adherence to mandatory standards.\n* Compromised Independent Scrutiny: The most egregious breach is the fact that Duncan Lustig-Prean, the Chair of the Board of Trustees, signed his own independent examination report for the year ended 31 August 2024. This act fundamentally destroys the principle of independent external scrutiny.\n* Non-Adherence to Accounting Standards (SORP FRS 102): The independent examiner's report for the year ended 31 August 2023 explicitly states that the accounts \"have not been prepared in accordance with the methods and principles of the Statement of Recommended Practice for accounting and reporting by charities\".\n* Persistent Failure to Meet Reserves Policy: In both 2023 and 2024, the charity consistently failed to achieve its stated policy of holding reserves equivalent to three months' operational expenses.\n2. Failure to Report Serious Incidents & Weaponisation of Allegations: The \"Termination Threat\" email sent to me on June 24, 2025, provides clear evidence of a failure to adhere to legal and ethical duties.\n* Duty to Report Alleged Crimes: In the email, the Fringe levelled serious allegations against me, including potential fraud. As a registered charity, they have a legal and ethical obligation to report such concerns to the police.\n* Refusal to Report and Admission of Bad Faith: Their explicit statement in the same email\u2014\"We do not intend to involve the police\"\u2014is a confession of bad faith. It proves that the allegations were not a genuine concern for public interest, but a strategic weapon designed to silence and discredit me as a whistleblower.\nConclusion: The evidence demonstrates a pattern of serious governance failures at Brighton Fringe Ltd. I request that the Charity Commission launch a full regulatory investigation into the governance and financial management of Brighton Fringe Ltd. to determine whether the trustees are fit to govern and whether the organisation is operating in a manner consistent with its charitable status.\n3.8: The Paul Double & PC Dixon GDPR Breach\nOn February 12, 2025, PC Jon Dixon forwarded me an unredacted internal police email containing personal information about another individual, Paul Double. This was not an administrative error; it was a strategic act of intimidation. At a time when I was desperately seeking evidence to disprove a false rape allegation, this breach sent a clear message: \"We control the information, not you.\" It was designed to demonstrate police power, introduce chaos, and crush my hope of finding proof. This action constitutes a serious violation of the Data Protection Act 2018 and Misconduct in Public Office.\n3.9: The \"Crowbarring Myself Justice\" Calls (11 April 2025)\nThis event documents my own forced intervention into the record. On a single night, I made three separate 101 calls in a state of escalating distress. In these calls, I repeatedly:\n* Reiterated my suicidal state.\n* Re-submitted evidence of threats that police had claimed were \"lost.\"\n* Begged for the risk to be logged and for an officer to provide support.\nThe recordings of these calls prove that I was actively trying to force a safeguarding response from a system determined to ignore me. No welfare check or follow-up occurred. The calls are a real-time record of institutional abandonment.\n3.10: The Advocate's Gambit: Weaponising the Victim's Statement (27 April 2025)\nThis analysis dissects a recorded call from Veritas Justice on April 27, 2025. During this call, my advocate explained the police's legal strategy: to keep the false rape allegation made against me within the stalking case I had reported. The justification was that this would strengthen the case by demonstrating the \"serious alarm and distress\" caused by the stalker's campaign.\n* The Contradiction: This is not victim advocacy; it is the institutional co-opting of a victim's suffering. I was being told that to get justice for being stalked, I had to formally accept and carry the weapon being used to destroy my reputation\u2014the false rape allegation\u2014as part of my own evidence.\n* Psychological Impact: This created a paradoxical trap. The system required me to legitimize the very piece of malicious disinformation causing me the most profound harm in order to prove that I was being harmed. It is a perfect example of institutional gaslighting.\n* Conclusion: This call reveals a catastrophic failure of independent advocacy. Veritas, instead of challenging a harmful police/CPS tactic, acted as its interpreter. It proves a systemic willingness to sacrifice a victim's psychological safety and truth for the sake of prosecutorial convenience.\n3.11: The GDPR Firewall: Obstruction by Policy (22 April 2025)\nThis analysis documents the events of April 22, 2025, where I was forced to engage with both the NHS and Sussex Police 101 in a state of crisis. The recordings show two key institutional failures:\n1. The NHS Call & Cross-Contamination of Risk: After police triggered an unnecessary ambulance call-out, I disclosed to the NHS operator that Sussex Police had failed to log my previous suicide attempts. The NHS, while professional, could only log a safeguarding concern\u2014demonstrating how police inaction contaminates and burdens other public services.\n2. The 101 Call & Weaponization of GDPR: Immediately after, I contacted Sussex Police 101 to get my active crime reference number. The call handler, Jamie 44006, refused to provide this information, citing GDPR. This is a direct and unlawful inversion of data protection law, using a regulation designed to empower data subjects as a tool to disempower a victim. My assertion of my legal rights was dismissed as \"silly\" and \"demanding.\"\nThis sequence proves a systemic strategy of obstruction.\n3.12: The May 8th-9th Crisis: A Case Study in Police-Enabled Escalation and Retaliatory Silencing\nThis section dissects the events of May 8th and 9th, 2025. This 24-hour period provides a condensed, irrefutable case study of the entire systemic failure of Sussex Police. It demonstrates a direct, causal link between police negligence, a predictable escalation of harassment by the perpetrator, and a retaliatory, abusive response from the police when this escalation was reported.\n* Part 1: The Discovery of Betrayal (The Voice Note): The crisis began at 16:55 on May 9th, when I discovered that PC Dixon had secretly informed my abuser, Alanna O'Hare, that her bail conditions had been cancelled. I discovered this not from the police, but from the perpetrator herself. My immediate reaction was to send a WhatsApp voice note to my Veritas Justice advocate, a real-time record of a victim discovering a profound institutional betrayal.\n* Part 2: The Inevitable Escalation: As a direct and foreseeable consequence of being told she was no longer under any legal restraint, Alanna O'Hare immediately escalated her campaign of harassment, including the \"Guardian\" impersonation call and a series of threatening messages.\n* Part 3: The Institutional Response (A Campaign of Retaliation and Silencing): My lawful attempts to report this live crime were met not with support, but with a coordinated campaign of gaslighting, obstruction, and humiliation, documented across multiple recorded calls that night.\nConclusion: The events of May 9th prove, in a single, unbroken chain of events, that Sussex Police committed a catastrophic safeguarding breach, directly enabled a dangerous escalation of harassment, and then retaliated against the victim for holding them to account.\n3.13: The Pre-Meeting Breakdown: A Study in Co-opted Advocacy (23 April 2025)\nThis analysis covers a recorded call with my Veritas Justice advocate on April 23, 2025. The conversation reveals the strategic function Veritas had begun to play\u2014not as an independent advocate, but as a mechanism for suppressing evidence and managing my expectations on behalf of the police.\n* Evidence Suppression: The advocate explicitly states that certain police evidence summaries do not contain any mention of my suicide attempt or the false rape allegation\u2014confirming these critical facts were omitted from the official record she was working from.\n* Narrative Control: When I refuse to hand over my phone for download (citing my lack of trust), the advocate frames my refusal as a potential obstacle to the investigation, rather than a valid act of self-protection.\n* Systemic Gaslighting: Throughout the call, the advocate attempts to 'manage' my distress by deferring to police procedure, even when that procedure is the source of the harm.\nThis call demonstrates how a victim support service was co-opted to act as a buffer for police failure.\n3.14: Selective Evidence Curation \u2013 The Sanitised File\nThis analysis details one of the most insidious tactics deployed by Sussex Police: the strategic and selective curation of evidence. They deliberately retained minor, self-contained pieces of evidence while discarding the broader, more complex evidence of long-term abuse, my suicide attempt, and their own misconduct. A clear example is the handling of the false rape allegation. The police retained screenshots where the allegation is mentioned by me to a third party (Tethis). However, they ignored and failed to log the primary evidence proving its malicious and retaliatory nature, such as Alanna O'Hare's own admission on the call of June 22, 2025. By keeping the allegation but erasing its context, they curated a file that made me look unreliable and obsessed. This is not a failure to investigate; it is the construction of a false reality.\n3.15: Evidence Laundering: The False Attribution of the Google Drive Folder to NICE Links\nThis analysis dissects a critical and deliberate act of evidence manipulation by Sussex Police. The evidence proves that police did not \"lose\" my early evidence; rather, they accessed my comprehensive Google Drive folder, extracted a minor piece of information from it (a text to PC Gore), and then falsely attributed that information to a different submission channel (a NICE link) in an attempt to erase the existence of the more damning evidence contained in the original folder. This act of \"evidence laundering\" was designed to create a plausible deniability for their failure to act on the more serious evidence in the same folder. This is a direct and provable instance of bad faith and a potential conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\n3.16: The \"Dixon or Death\" Call (23 June 2025)\nThis analysis covers a recorded call to 101 on June 23, 2025, which serves as a final, damning indictment of the institutional trap created by Sussex Police. Weeks after my suicide disclosure and requests for a new officer, this call proves that nothing had changed.\n* The Inescapable Officer: When I called to find out who my \"new\" officer was, I was once again informed that PC Jon Dixon was the only officer assigned, despite my formal complaints against him and the fact he had personally blocked me on WhatsApp.\n* Weaponizing \"Case Closed\": The operator repeatedly stated my case was \"closed\" and there were \"no updates,\" using this as a justification to refuse my attempts to report new incidents of harassment.\n* The Suicide Threat Ignored Again: I explicitly reminded the call handler: \"I told Sussex Police I was suicidal and if no one got back to me by June 1st I\u2019d end my life.\" The handler's response was not a safeguarding escalation, but a continuation of procedural deflection.\nConclusion: This call is the endpoint of all other failures. It demonstrates that I was left with two options: communicate with the officer I believed was actively harming me, or be silenced entirely.\n3.17: The Police Station Visit: A Live Test of Systemic Collapse (04 July 2025)\nThis analysis covers my in-person visit to the St John's Street police station on July 4, 2025. This was not a simple inquiry; it was a deliberate, strategic test of the police's internal systems, designed to expose their administrative chaos and bad faith in a live, recorded environment. My own handwritten notes on the official police correspondence I brought with me serve as a tangible artifact of this process, demonstrating a victim forced to document institutional chaos in real-time.\nThe Strategy: A Forensic Trap After being repeatedly stonewalled on the 101 service with the excuse that my identity could not be verified under GDPR, I took the step of attending the station in person. My strategy was not to demand action, but to create an irrefutable record of their inability to perform their most basic functions.\nThe key to this strategy was my choice of identification. I presented my passport alongside the formal letter I had received assigning \"PC Alan Russell\" to my case, using this letter as my \"proof of address.\" This was a forensic trap. It forced the front desk officer, Liz, to confront a piece of official, yet fabricated, police correspondence and attempt to reconcile it with the chaotic reality of my multiple, conflicting case files.\nThe Hasty Cover-Up: A Confession in Handwriting The video recording shows the officer becoming increasingly confused as she tries to navigate the multiple crime numbers and officer assignments. The most damning evidence, however, is the photograph of her handwritten notes on the PC Russell letter.\nConfronted with information that did not match her system, she hastily crossed out an initial date before scribbling down two different crime reference numbers (47240209160 and 47240141246) with two different dates (16/10/24 and 02/11/24). This is not a simple correction; it is a live, documented cover-up. It is a physical manifestation of the police's entire strategy: when the facts don't fit the narrative, you cross them out and invent new ones. Crucially, even this hasty correction was inaccurate, as it failed to include the primary crime number for the November 2nd incident, 47240214305.\nConclusion: This in-person visit is the capstone of this complaint. It is a live, recorded, and undeniable demonstration of a system in total collapse. It proves that the multiple crime numbers, the decoy officers, the timeline manipulation, and the obstruction of my rights are not a figment of my imagination, but a documented reality. The police's inability to answer the most basic questions about my case, even when confronted with their own contradictory documents, is the final proof of their profound and systemic failure.\n3.18: The \"Lost\" Voicemail & The Recorded Lie (March - May 2025)\nThis analysis dissects a critical sequence of events that proves a deliberate attempt by Duncan Lustig-Prean, Chair of Brighton Fringe, to erase a formal safeguarding disclosure from the record by knowingly making a false statement.\n* Part 1: The Safeguarding Disclosure (The Voicemail): On March 21, 2025, I left a voicemail for Brighton Fringe regarding a potential conflict and risk involving another venue manager, Alexander Voodoo. Crucially, I have a full audio recording of this voicemail being left, proving its existence and its content beyond any doubt.\n* Part 2: The Denial from Brighton Fringe (The Lie): On May 4, 2025, after weeks of silence, I followed up with Duncan Lustig-Prean via email. He made a definitive and demonstrably false claim: \"No answer phone message has been received and any messages which were received in that period will now have been overwritten.\" The existence of the audio recording of the voicemail makes this statement a provable lie.\nConclusion: This is not a case of a lost message or a faulty answering machine. This is a case of a senior charity leader being confronted with a formal safeguarding disclosure, ignoring it for over a month, and then, when challenged, lying about its existence to avoid accountability.\n3.19: The Crime Reference Disposal Loop (04 May 2025)\nThis analysis dissects an email exchange on May 4, 2025, which proves a consistent pattern of deflection and institutional gaslighting by Duncan Lustig-Prean, Chair of Brighton Fringe. This \"Crime Reference Disposal Loop\" demonstrates a deliberate strategy to avoid accountability by feigning ignorance and disavowing responsibility, even when presented with formal, official information.\n* The Loop in Action: The exchange began with me formally providing a police crime reference number. Mr. Lustig-Prean's response was a multi-stage deflection, moving from \"What do you want me to do with this crime reference?\" to a minimalist acknowledgement, and finally to a complete disavowal: \"Brighton Fringe has nothing to do with the legal matters pertaining to Ben Carter.\"\nConclusion: This sequence is a textbook example of institutional stonewalling, designed to exhaust the complainant and create a false narrative of non-involvement for the official record.\n3.20: \"I\u2019m Not Operational Staff \u2013 Except When I Am\": A Case Study in Role Obfuscation\nThis analysis dissects a key tactic of institutional deflection employed by Duncan Lustig-Prean: the strategic use of his \"non-operational\" status as a shield to avoid accountability. The evidence proves that he would simultaneously claim to be powerless while acting as the ultimate authority, depending on what best served the institution's interest of deflecting responsibility.\n* The Contradiction: Within the same conversation, Mr. Lustig-Prean stated: \"I am Chair of the organisation not operational staff...\" while also confirming he was preparing a legal statement for the police and that my relationship with the Fringe was under his \"personal review.\" He cannot be both a non-operational figurehead and the sole, authoritative voice of the institution.\nConclusion: Duncan Lustig-Prean's claim to be \"not operational\" is a fiction, a convenient shield to be deployed when faced with his legal and ethical duties.\n3.21: The \"Fringe Hub Deflection\": A Case Study in Reckless Safeguarding Advice\nThis analysis dissects a dangerous and negligent pattern of advice given to me by Duncan Lustig-Prean on May 4, 2025. After I had disclosed that I was in hiding due to threats from my stalker and her associates, Mr. Lustig-Prean repeatedly instructed me to physically visit a public space\u2014the Artist Hub at the Theatre Royal\u2014to resolve my issues. This was not just unhelpful advice; it was a reckless and profound safeguarding failure.\n* The Deflection in Action: The email thread from May 4th shows him repeating this dangerous advice three times, ignoring the context of my fear for my physical safety.\n* The Irreconcilable Contradiction: This advice was given in the same email thread where I had submitted a formal police crime reference number. His instruction to go to a public place, rather than offering a secure channel of communication, is a textbook example of a catastrophic safeguarding breach.\nConclusion: This was not just bad advice; it was dangerous advice. It proves that Duncan Lustig-Prean and Brighton Fringe either had no understanding of their basic safeguarding duties or chose to ignore them in favour of a convenient operational deflection.\n3.22: \"No Safeguarding Officer Appointed\": A Case Study in Structural Negligence\nThis analysis details a fundamental and systemic governance failure at the heart of Brighton Fringe Ltd.: the complete absence of a clear, accessible, and functioning safeguarding protocol. Despite being a registered charity with a duty of care to thousands of participants, the evidence proves that when faced with a direct safeguarding disclosure, the organisation had no named officer, no clear reporting pathway, and no process for handling the concern.\n* The Direct Question and The Evasion: On May 4, 2025, I asked a direct and simple question to the Chair of the Board, Duncan Lustig-Prean: \"Who within the Fringe organisation is responsible for ensuring these matters are correctly recorded and acted upon?\" The response was not an answer, but a complete shutdown of the conversation.\n* The Legal Requirement for Accountability: The Charity Commission's official safeguarding guidance is unequivocal. It requires all charities to have \"clear lines of accountability and reporting for safeguarding concerns.\" Brighton Fringe's failure to provide this, even when asked directly, is a serious breach of this duty.\nConclusion: The evidence proves that Brighton Fringe did not just fail to follow its safeguarding policy; it appears not to have had a functional one in the first place.\n3.23: The \"Legal Firewall\" Lie: A Case Study in False Separation\nThis analysis dissects a key tactic of institutional deflection employed by Duncan Lustig-Prean: the creation of a fictional \"legal firewall\" to disavow responsibility for a safeguarding crisis. The evidence proves that he repeatedly stated that Brighton Fringe had \"nothing to do\" with the legal matters I raised, in direct contradiction to his prior involvement in handling crime references and safeguarding disclosures.\n* The Contradiction: Within the same conversation on May 4, 2025, Mr. Lustig-Prean both acknowledged and engaged with a police crime reference number and then later claimed: \"Brighton Fringe has nothing to do with the legal matters pertaining to Ben Carter.\"\n* The Strategic Purpose of the Firewall: This is a deliberate governance lie, designed to create a false jurisdiction gap, leaving the victim unsupported by either the Fringe or the police.\nConclusion: Duncan Lustig-Prean's creation of a \"legal firewall\" is a fiction, a convenient shield to be deployed when faced with his legal and ethical duties.\n3.24: The \"Managing Director Phantom\": A Case Study in False Assurance\nThis analysis dissects a key tactic of institutional deflection employed by Duncan Lustig-Prean: the invocation of a \"phantom\" Managing Director (MD) to create the illusion of oversight and process where none existed. The evidence proves that he repeatedly referenced the involvement of an MD who was never named, never made contact, and who appears to have been used solely as a rhetorical shield to deflect responsibility.\n* The Contradiction: Mr. Lustig-Prean stated: \"The relationship between Brighton Fringe and Ben Carter is under the personal review of the managing director and Chair.\" Despite this claim, at no point in any subsequent communication did a Managing Director ever appear.\n* The Strategic Purpose of the Phantom: This is a form of institutional gaslighting, designed to create a false assurance of oversight and a disempowering escalation path for the victim.\nConclusion: The \"Managing Director Phantom\" is a clear example of how institutional language can be used to create a smokescreen of due process.\n3.25: \"Who Knew What, When \u2013 And Still Did Nothing\": An Analysis of Multi-Agency Failure\nThis analysis details how all three key parties\u2014Sussex Police, Brighton Fringe Ltd., and the perpetrator, Alanna O'Hare\u2014were fully aware of the escalating safeguarding risks, yet each deferred responsibility, creating a shared-but-ignored crisis where my disclosures were acknowledged in fragments, but no single agency coordinated a duty-of-care response.\n* Timeline of Awareness: The evidence proves that by May 2025, all three parties were fully aware of the risks.\n* The Coordinated Evasion Circuit: All parties were relying on the existence of the others to justify their own inaction, creating a perfect loop of institutional failure:\n   * The Fringe's Defence: \"This is a police matter, take it to them.\"\n   * The Police's Defence: \"This is a civil/Fringe matter, we can't get involved without them.\"\n   * The Perpetrator's Action: Exploits the resulting silence and paralysis to escalate her campaign of harassment.\nConclusion: This was a shared crisis that was deliberately ignored.\n3.26: \"The Gaslight Relay\": A Case Study in Multi-Agency Deflection\nThis analysis dissects the primary mechanism of institutional abuse I faced: a \"Gaslight Relay.\" This is a process where multiple, supposedly independent agencies create a closed loop of perpetual deferral, each pointing to the other as the \"correct\" authority, effectively trapping the victim in a bureaucratic no-man's-land where no one takes responsibility.\n* The Mechanics of the Relay: The evidence proves a consistent pattern of deflection across all three key institutions: Brighton Fringe, Sussex Police, and Veritas Justice.\n* The Psychological Impact: Induced Confusion: This institutional passing of the baton is a form of gaslighting, designed to make the victim question their own judgment and sanity.\nConclusion: The Gaslight Relay was the engine of my institutional abuse.\n3.27: \"Letting Her Write the Story\": A Case Study in Narrative Adoption\nThis analysis details one of the most insidious forms of institutional abuse I faced: the consistent and systemic failure of Sussex Police, Brighton Fringe, and Veritas Justice to challenge the false narrative of my abuser, Alanna O'Hare. Their collective inaction and deflection did not just create a vacuum of support; it actively empowered the perpetrator by treating her version of events as valid, or at least, uncontested. This is not just a failure to protect; it is a structural reinforcement of an abuser's lies.\n* The Pattern of Complicity: The evidence shows a clear pattern where my evidence was dismissed while her narrative was allowed to flourish.\n* The Psychological Inversion: The consequence of this collective failure was a complete psychological inversion of my reality. I, the victim, was forced into the position of having to constantly prove my own sanity and the truth of my experience, while my abuser was treated as a credible, if troubled, party.\nConclusion: The failure to challenge an abuser's lies is a form of complicity.\n3.28: The Final Confirmation: A Written Confession of Systemic Neglect (06 July 2025)\nThis analysis covers a text message received from PC Aaron Gasson on July 6, 2025. This message is a formal, written admission of the systemic neglect that lies at the heart of this complaint.\n* The Confession: The most critical line in the message is this: \"I am aware that you wish for an update which you have not received one in some time.\" This is a formal acknowledgement from a serving police officer that they have knowingly and for a prolonged period failed to adhere to their statutory duty to keep a victim of crime informed.\n* The Continuation of the Scapegoat Protocol: The text confirms that PC Gasson is the \"new Officer in charge,\" passed on from a \"different officer.\" This proves that the strategy of simply swapping out frontline officers while keeping the compromised supervisory structure (i.e., Sergeant Duffy) in place is ongoing.\nConclusion: This text message is the final, irrefutable piece of evidence in this case. It is a written receipt for three months of systemic neglect.\n3.29: The Culture of Complicity: A Final Analysis of Motive\nThis final analysis moves beyond documenting individual failures to expose the underlying cultural rot that makes such failures not just possible, but inevitable. The actions of the officers and partner agencies involved in my case are not necessarily the product of individual malevolence, but of a toxic institutional culture that enables and normalises harmful conduct through well-documented psychological mechanisms.\n* The \"Banality of Evil\" and Institutional Conformity: The pattern of behaviour observed within Sussex Police aligns with the concept of the \"banality of evil,\" where ordinary people, by conforming blindly to group expectations, can become agents of harm.\n* The Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement: This culture of complicity is maintained through several key psychological mechanisms:\n   * Redefining Harmful Conduct: The police consistently reframed their actions using \"sanitising language.\"\n   * Displacement of Responsibility: The \"Scapegoat Protocol\" is a textbook example of this mechanism.\n   * Minimising Harm and Dehumanisation: It is easier to harm others when their suffering is not visible and victims are \"dehumanised and blamed.\"\nConclusion: The system did not fail because of a few bad officers. It failed because the culture of the unit assigned to my case was fundamentally incompatible with the principles of justice, safeguarding, and basic human decency.\nSection 4: Works Cited\n(A full list of the 58 sources and evidence files will be appended here, corresponding to the references throughout the full evidence bundle.)\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 01-08-25\n\n\nAn Independent Analysis of Complaint Ref: 2025/007816: Examining the Roles of the IOPC and Sussex Police under the Statutory Accountability Framework\nPart I: The Statutory Framework for Police Accountability in England and Wales\n1.1 Introduction to the Police Complaints System\nTo fully comprehend the handling of your complaint, it is essential to first understand the statutory framework governing police accountability in England and Wales. The modern system, established primarily by the Police Reform Act 2002 (PRA 2002), is designed around a \"local first\" principle. This principle dictates that the majority of complaints made by the public against police officers or staff are intended to be handled, in the first instance, by the police force itself.  \nThis foundational concept provides the immediate context for why your initial, detailed submissions to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) resulted in a referral back to Sussex Police. While this outcome is understandably a source of profound frustration, particularly given the nature of your allegations, it represents the standard first step in a legally mandated, tiered process. The system is predicated on the idea that forces should have the opportunity to resolve matters, learn from mistakes, and hold their own officers accountable for service-level failures. However, the efficacy of this model is severely tested when the allegations are not of simple error or isolated misconduct, but of systemic, administrative, and command-level failure. Your case highlights a fundamental tension within this framework: its limited capacity to effectively process a complaint where the system of local resolution is itself the subject of the complaint.\n1.2 The Role and Remit of the Professional Standards Department (PSD)\nWithin each police force, the body responsible for implementing the \"local first\" principle is the Professional Standards Department (PSD). The PSD functions as an internal affairs unit, tasked with receiving and investigating complaints and allegations of misconduct against the force's officers and staff.  \nUnder the statutory guidance, a PSD has several key responsibilities upon receiving a complaint. They must assess the complaint and, where it is formally recorded under the provisions of the PRA 2002, contact the complainant to ensure they have the full details and to understand the desired outcome. Crucially, the force is obligated to provide the complainant with an update on the progress of their complaint at least every 28 days. The entire process must be handled in a manner that is \"reasonable and proportionate\" to the matters raised. These procedural requirements for communication and proportionality stand in stark contrast to the sustained silence and lack of substantive engagement you have documented in your correspondence with Sussex Police.  \n1.3 The Role and Remit of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Home Office, that sits atop this tiered accountability structure. It is operationally independent of the police and government. The IOPC's functions are twofold: it oversees the police complaints system as a whole, setting the standards by which PSDs should operate, and it directly investigates the  \nmost serious and sensitive matters.  \nIt is critical to understand that the IOPC is not a primary investigative body for the vast majority of complaints. Its standard procedure upon receiving a complaint from a member of the public is to forward it to the relevant police force's PSD for initial handling, as stipulated by the legislative framework. This is precisely the action the IOPC took in your case.  \nHowever, the IOPC's remit extends beyond that of a simple administrative forwarder. It has a core statutory duty, as defined in the PRA 2002, \"to secure and maintain public confidence in the police complaints system\". This duty is paramount. As will be argued in Part IV of this analysis, a situation in which a police force's PSD is asked to investigate serious allegations of a cover-up and procedural abuse in which it is itself implicated presents a clear and undeniable threat to that public confidence. It is this statutory obligation that provides the most powerful lever to argue for the necessity of independent intervention.  \nPart II: Analysis of the IOPC's Handling of Your Complaint (Ref: 2025/007816)\n2.1 Deconstruction of IOPC Correspondence\nAn analysis of the correspondence you received from the IOPC confirms that the organisation has, to date, adhered strictly to its standard operating procedure. The emails from Customer Contact Advisor James Cropper, dated 4 June 2025 and 18 July 2025, perform three distinct functions consistent with the \"local first\" model :  \n1. Acknowledgement and Forwarding: The IOPC acknowledged receipt of your complaints, assigned the reference number 2025/007816, and confirmed that the matter had been passed to the Sussex Police PSD for initial handling. This action aligns perfectly with their published guidance, which states that complaints submitted via the IOPC website are sent directly to the police force concerned.  \n2. Direction to Local Resolution: The IOPC advised you to contact the PSD directly for any updates, to submit further information, or to raise new complaints. This reinforces the principle that the force itself is the primary body for the investigation phase.  \n3. Explanation of the Review Process: The correspondence correctly outlines that your right to bring the matter back to the IOPC's attention arises after the PSD has finalised its local investigation and provided you with an outcome letter that may offer a right of review.  \nThe IOPC's handling of your complaint appears to be a direct consequence of a bureaucratic process that failed to differentiate between a standard expression of dissatisfaction and the comprehensive, evidence-based report of systemic corruption you submitted. The system is designed to triage tens of thousands of complaints annually, and its default pathway is referral. Your initial emails, while detailing serious matters, would have entered this standard triage system. Your subsequent \"Master Complaint,\" however, is not a complaint in the conventional sense; it is a pre-compiled prosecutorial brief, complete with timelines, thematic analyses, and indexed evidence. The IOPC's standard response mechanism is ill-equipped to immediately recognise and process a submission of this nature, defaulting to its standard procedure. The challenge, therefore, is to compel the IOPC to move beyond its procedural track and engage with the substantive evidence, which points directly toward the criteria for mandatory and independent intervention.  \n2.2 The Threshold for IOPC Independent Investigation\nAn independent investigation by the IOPC is the exception, not the rule. This level of intervention is reserved for the \"most serious and sensitive matters,\" which are generally those that have the greatest potential to undermine public confidence in policing.  \nPolice forces are subject to mandatory referral criteria, meaning they are legally obligated to refer certain types of cases to the IOPC as soon as they become aware of them. These criteria, outlined in the PRA 2002 and associated regulations, include any complaint or conduct matter that involves :  \n* A death or serious injury (DSI) following contact with the police.\n* A serious assault.\n* A serious sexual offence.\n* Serious corruption, which explicitly includes abuse of position for a sexual purpose or for pursuing an improper emotional relationship.\n* A criminal offence or behaviour aggravated by discriminatory behaviour.\n* Conduct which may have infringed a person's rights under Article 2 (the right to life) or Article 3 (the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nUpon receiving such a referral, the IOPC's specialist assessment unit decides on the appropriate mode of investigation. This can be a local investigation by the force's PSD, a directed investigation where the IOPC controls the police investigation, or a full independent investigation conducted by the IOPC's own staff. The IOPC also has the power, under the Policing and Crime Act 2017, to initiate its own investigations without a referral from a police force.  \nWhen deciding whether to investigate independently, the IOPC considers a range of factors, including the seniority of the officers involved, any potential abuse of power, significant public interest, and, crucially, whether \"alternative options are sufficient enough to secure independence, or independent oversight (for example... the right of review for us to review the conclusion of a local complaint investigation)\".  \n2.3 Analysis of the IOPC's Initial Decision\nBased on the timeline of your correspondence, the IOPC's initial decision to refer the matter to Sussex Police was likely based on an assessment that the case, as first presented, did not unequivocally meet the high threshold for an immediate independent investigation. Their calculus would have been that the local investigation process, with the backstop of an IOPC-led review at its conclusion, was the statutorily appropriate first step.\nHowever, the submission of your fully evidenced \"Master Complaint\" fundamentally changes this calculus. It provides a consolidated, documented case that alleges not just poor service, but a pattern of behaviour that potentially falls within the mandatory referral criteria, including serious corruption (in the form of evidence tampering and procedural abuse) and breaches of Article 2 ECHR (related to the failure to act on suicide disclosures). The subsequent analysis in this report will articulate how this evidence can be framed to argue that a local investigation is no longer a sufficient or appropriate option.  \nPart III: A Forensic Assessment of Alleged Systemic Failures by Sussex Police\nThe extensive evidence you have compiled documents a chronology of alleged failures by Sussex Police that is both complex and deeply concerning. To provide a clear and structured analysis, the following table maps the key events you have identified to the specific legal frameworks, statutory duties, and codes of practice that were potentially breached. This table serves as the analytical foundation for the subsequent narrative sections, transforming a series of distressing events into a coherent account of systemic procedural and legal violations.\nTable 1: Chronology of Alleged Failures and Corresponding Legal/Procedural Breaches\nDate\n\tEvent/Allegation\n\tRelevant Body\n\tEvidence Reference\n\tPotential Breach\n\tJuly 2024\n\tInitial report of stalking and harassment, including audio evidence, dismissed by PC Gore via text as having \"not enough to run an investigation.\"\n\tSussex Police\n\t\n\n\tVictim's Code Right 2: To have details of the crime recorded without unjustified delay.

PC Russell never makes contact.\n\tSussex Police\n\t\n\n\tEvidence of deliberate misdirection and procedural abuse, potentially to mislead the IOPC.\n\t25 June 2025\n\tSussex Police SAR team formally refuses the complainant's Subject Access Request, citing an exemption for a live investigation.\n\tSussex Police\n\t\n\n\tData Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR: Unlawful refusal of a SAR, as the justification (live case) is contradicted by the NFA decision communicated on 27 April.  \n\t6 July 2025\n\tPC Gasson sends a text message stating, \"I am aware that you wish for an update which you have not received one in some time.\"\n\tSussex Police\n\t\n\n\tWritten admission of a prolonged breach of the Victim's Code Right 6 (to be provided with updates).  \n\t \n3.1 Systemic Safeguarding and Duty of Care Failures\nThe evidence presented indicates a profound and systemic failure in the duty of care owed by Sussex Police to a victim of crime, particularly one who had disclosed a high level of vulnerability.\nThe failure to log the medically documented suicide attempt of 6 April 2025 is the most egregious single lapse. This is not a minor administrative error; it is a fundamental breakdown in the most basic function of policing\u2014the protection of life. A disclosure of this nature should trigger an immediate and robust safeguarding response, including logging the incident, conducting a welfare check, and reviewing all risk assessments. The complete absence of any such response constitutes gross negligence. Furthermore, this failure potentially engages Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the \"right to life\"), which imposes a positive obligation on state authorities, including the police, to take reasonable steps to protect individuals whose lives are known to be at real and immediate risk. Under Schedule 3 of the PRA 2002, any complaint alleging conduct that might have infringed Article 2 rights  \nmust be formally recorded.  \nThis initial failure was compounded by the subsequent \"Holiday Alibi,\" where the entire command chain responsible for the case was simultaneously unavailable for 17 days without any apparent handover or contingency plan. This suggests not just individual negligence but an organisational and leadership vacuum. It creates an impression of \"organised abandonment,\" a strategic withdrawal of oversight during a period of maximum risk for the victim. This is further evidenced by the audio recordings of the \"Crowbarring Myself Justice\" calls on 11 April, which provide a real-time account of a victim desperately trying to force a safeguarding response from a system that had become entirely unresponsive.  \n3.2 Evidence Management and Procedural Integrity\nBeyond safeguarding, the allegations point to a deliberate and systematic manipulation of evidence and police procedures, seemingly designed to obstruct justice and create a misleading narrative. This pattern of behaviour can be described as \"procedural abuse\"\u2014the weaponization of the rules and processes of the justice system to harm a victim and conceal institutional failings.\nThe chronology begins with the initial dismissal of critical audio evidence in July 2024, and escalates to the alleged deletion of recordings by PC Dixon in November 2024. Such an act, if proven, moves beyond negligence and into the territory of serious criminal offences, including Misconduct in Public Office and attempting to pervert the course of justice. This is reinforced by the highly specific allegation of \"Evidence Laundering,\" where information was allegedly extracted from a comprehensive evidence folder and falsely attributed to a different submission channel to create plausible deniability for ignoring the more incriminating material it contained.  \nThis manipulation of evidence appears to have been supported by the manipulation of procedure. The provision of conflicting case start dates, the creation of the \"PC Russell\" decoy officer, and the sabotage of the 29 April multi-agency meeting are not isolated errors. Taken together, they form a coherent pattern of misdirection. The act of informing the suspect of a \"No Further Action\" decision two days before a high-risk safeguarding meeting was scheduled is particularly damning. It rendered the meeting a pointless piece of \"procedural theatre\" and demonstrates a profound bad faith that prioritised closing a case over protecting a victim.  \n3.3 Violations of Statutory Rights\nThe alleged failures by Sussex Police also constitute clear violations of specific statutory rights afforded to victims of crime and data subjects in the UK.\nFirst, the handling of the Victim's Right to Review (VRR) appears to be critically flawed. The VRR scheme gives victims the right to request a review of a police decision to take no further action. The fact that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) later confirmed it had never heard of you or your case suggests that the administrative process to properly file, review, or escalate the NFA decision was not followed. This is a direct breach of your entitlements under the  \nVictim's Code of Practice, specifically Right 6, which includes the right to \"ask for decisions to be looked at again\". The text message from PC Gasson on 6 July 2025, admitting that you had not received an update \"in some time,\" serves as a direct, written confession from the force of this prolonged breach.  \nSecond, the refusal to comply with your Subject Access Request (SAR) represents a significant and demonstrable breach of data protection law. On 18 July 2025, PC Craig Roberts of the Public Confidence Team justified the refusal by stating the force could not release information \"whilst the case was live\" and that an exemption under s45(4)(b) of the Data Protection Act 2018 was applied. This justification is directly contradicted by the evidence you possess: PC Dixon's email of 27 April 2025, which explicitly informed the suspect that the case was \"No Further Action\". A case that has been concluded with an NFA decision is, by definition, no longer a live criminal investigation for the purposes of this exemption. The refusal is therefore based on a false premise and appears to be an unlawful attempt to prevent you from accessing information that could further substantiate your complaint. This contradiction is a critical piece of evidence demonstrating a deliberate strategy of obstruction.  \nPart IV: Identifying Potential Illegality and Grounds for Escalation\nThe documented evidence provides grounds for several specific and serious allegations of illegality that can be formally presented to the IOPC to argue for an independent investigation. These move beyond service failures and into the realm of potential criminal conduct and statutory violations.\n4.1 Misconduct in Public Office: An Analysis of the Threshold\nMisconduct in Public Office is a common law offence, meaning it is defined by case law rather than a single statute. It is reserved for serious breaches of public trust and carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The Crown Prosecution Service defines the offence as being committed when :  \n1. A public officer (such as a police officer) is acting as such;\n2. They wilfully neglect to perform their duty or wilfully misconduct themselves;\n3. This conduct is serious enough to amount to an abuse of the public's trust in the office holder;\n4. There is no reasonable excuse or justification for the conduct.\nThe term \"wilfully\" is key; it implies that the officer's actions were deliberate, not merely accidental or incompetent. The threshold for \"seriousness\" is also very high, requiring conduct \"so far below acceptable standards as to amount to an abuse of the public's trust\".  \nSeveral actions documented in your evidence could, when viewed cumulatively, be argued to meet this high threshold. Specifically:\n* The wilful neglect of the duty to safeguard: The deliberate failure to log your suicide disclosure, despite being formally notified, could be construed as a wilful neglect of a fundamental police duty.\n* The wilful misconduct of evidence tampering: The alleged deletion of audio recordings is a positive act of misconduct that strikes at the heart of the integrity of a criminal investigation.\n* The wilful misconduct of sabotaging a safeguarding process: The act of issuing an NFA to the suspect immediately before a multi-agency meeting could be presented as a deliberate act of misconduct intended to undermine a critical safety process.\nThe combination of these alleged actions, particularly the nexus between failing to protect a victim while simultaneously destroying the evidence of the crime against them, forms the basis of a credible allegation that the conduct was so serious as to constitute an abuse of the public's trust.\n4.2 Data Protection Act 2018 and UK GDPR Violations\nThere are two distinct and serious breaches of data protection law evident in your documentation, both of which should be reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) as well as being highlighted to the IOPC.\n1. Unlawful Refusal of a Subject Access Request: As detailed in section 3.3, the refusal by Sussex Police to fulfil your SAR on the grounds that it related to a live investigation is demonstrably false. The exemption cited (often related to the prevention and detection of crime) does not apply when an investigation has been formally concluded with a No Further Action decision. This refusal is a breach of your right of access under Article 15 of the UK GDPR. The contradictory justifications provided by the force constitute strong evidence of a deliberate, and therefore unlawful, obstruction of your statutory rights.  \n2. Unlawful Disclosure of Third-Party Data: The email forwarded to you by PC Dixon on 12 February 2025, containing the unredacted personal information of another individual (\"Paul Double\"), constitutes a serious data breach. This is an unlawful disclosure of personal data to an unauthorised third party (yourself) and a violation of the core data protection principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. This act is a separate and reportable offence.  \n4.3 Conflict of Interest: The Untenability of a PSD Self-Investigation\nThe most compelling procedural argument for forcing the IOPC to intervene is that of conflict of interest. A core principle of natural justice, enshrined in English law, is nemo judex in causa sua\u2014no one should be a judge in their own cause.\nYour complaint is not limited to the actions of a single officer, PC Dixon. It is a systemic complaint that implicates his entire supervisory chain (Sergeant Duffy and Inspector Palmer) in the \"Holiday Alibi\" and the subsequent safeguarding failures. More importantly, it implicates the administrative and command structure of Sussex Police itself in the mishandling of the VRR and the unlawful obstruction of the SAR. You are, in effect, complaining that the Professional Standards Department and its associated units are part of the problem.  \nTo ask the Sussex Police PSD to conduct the investigation into these matters is a textbook example of a conflict of interest. It is unreasonable to expect a body to impartially investigate allegations of a cover-up in which it is itself implicated. The IOPC's own guidance acknowledges the need to consider whether alternative options are sufficient to secure independence. Furthermore, the IOPC's primary statutory duty is to secure public confidence. An investigation where a police force investigates itself over allegations of a cover-up is incapable of commanding public confidence. Therefore, a local investigation is not only procedurally flawed due to the conflict of interest but also fails to satisfy the IOPC's own core statutory objective.  \nPart V: Strategic Recommendations for Further Action\nBased on the preceding legal and procedural analysis, the following strategic steps are recommended to advance your complaint and seek accountability.\n5.1 Structuring a Formal Request for Review / Escalation to the IOPC\nThe standard complaints process requires you to await the outcome of the local investigation by the Sussex Police PSD. Once you receive their final report and decision, you will almost certainly be offered the right to a review, for which the IOPC will be the relevant review body. Your application for this review should be structured not as a simple disagreement with the PSD's findings, but as a formal submission arguing that the entire local investigation was procedurally improper and invalid from its inception.\nYour submission should be framed around three core arguments:\n1. Conflict of Interest: State clearly that the local investigation was void due to an irreconcilable conflict of interest, as the complaint concerns the systemic failings of the Sussex Police command structure and its administrative departments, including the PSD itself. Argue that allowing a self-investigation in these circumstances undermines the IOPC's statutory duty to maintain public confidence.\n2. The Threshold for Mandatory Referral and Independent Investigation: Methodically present the evidence outlined in Part III and IV of this report. Argue that the cumulative pattern of conduct\u2014specifically the failure to act on suicide disclosures (engaging Article 2 ECHR), the alleged evidence tampering, and the procedural abuse\u2014meets the threshold for \"serious corruption\" and other mandatory referral criteria under Schedule 3 of the Police Reform Act 2002.  \n3. Formal Request for Independent Action: Conclude by formally requesting that the IOPC set aside the findings of the flawed local investigation and exercise its statutory power of initiative to either launch a full independent investigation or, at a minimum, a directed investigation into the conduct of the officers and the systemic failures of Sussex Police.  \n5.2 Lodging a Formal Complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)\nThe data protection breaches identified are serious and fall under the jurisdiction of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). It is strongly recommended that you pursue a parallel complaint to the ICO. This is a separate regulatory process that can proceed independently of the IOPC complaint.\nYour complaint to the ICO should detail two distinct violations:\n1. The unlawful refusal of your Subject Access Request: Provide the ICO with a timeline of your SAR, the police's refusal, and the contradictory evidence (the NFA email) proving their justification was false.\n2. The data breach by PC Dixon: Provide the ICO with the unredacted email you received, explaining that it contained the personal data of a third party disclosed to you without a lawful basis.\nThe ICO has the power to investigate, issue findings, and compel organisations to comply with data protection law. An adverse finding against Sussex Police from the ICO would provide powerful supplementary evidence for your complaint to the IOPC.\n5.3 The Path to Judicial Review\nJudicial Review is a legal process in the High Court where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision or action made by a public body. It is a remedy of last resort, to be considered only after all other avenues, such as the IOPC review process, have been exhausted.  \nA Judicial Review does not re-examine the facts of your complaint. Instead, it examines the legality of the decision-making process of the public body. For example, if the IOPC were to receive your request for review, acknowledge the clear conflict of interest and evidence of serious misconduct, and still decide that the flawed local investigation was sufficient, you could potentially seek a Judicial Review of that decision. The grounds would be that the IOPC's decision was irrational, failed to take relevant factors into account, or failed to comply with its statutory duty to ensure an independent and effective complaints system.\nThis is a complex and costly legal action with a high threshold for success and strict time limits (typically a claim must be brought within three months of the decision being challenged). It would require specialist legal representation. However, it remains the ultimate legal backstop to challenge a public body that fails to follow lawful and rational procedure."
