# 📁 03_timelines/meta/

This folder contains **meta-level timeline entries** — moments that shape the architecture, analysis, or strategic shifts in the project. These are not standard evidence events but **structural or investigative pivots**.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

- Track when a contradiction thread was created or updated
- Mark major bundle releases or new complaint structures
- Log timeline schema changes or tool shifts (e.g., first use of VEX tags)
- Reflect strategic decisions, inflection points, or escalation triggers

---

## 📂 Examples

```json
{
  "date": "2025-06-07",
  "event": "Death By Silence timeline formally created",
  "linked_to": ["timeline_layer_death_by_silence", "contradiction_cluster_sussex_police"],
  "notes": "This marks the start of tracking institutional silence as an active form of escalation and harm."
}
```
